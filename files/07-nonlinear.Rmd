# Non-Linear Models


## Transformations 

- Transformations of Response

Above discussion has shown that some assumptions are not valid for VMT and urban form variables.
Gravity law and Zipf's law also imply that taking logarithm transformations is a proper choice.

Among the above literature, some regression models take logarithm transforms on all variables, while others only transform one or a part. Even though they have various data sources, it is unlikely that they are all correct or equivalent.
