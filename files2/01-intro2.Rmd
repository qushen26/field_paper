-   Background

In the past decades, efforts have been made to reduce Automobile Dependency in developed and developing counties. Many researchers have found that moderating car use has positive social, economic, and environmental impacts. The negative externalities of automobiles include, but are not limited to, congestion, collision, unhealthy lifestyle, urban sprawl, social segmentation, pollution, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.

In urban planning and transportation, achieving this goal requires two parts. First, researchers find a set of factors that could mainly explain and affect travel behavior. Second, planning and policy are made to intervene in the modifiable factors to reduce car use then significantly. This paper focuses on the first part and aims at supporting the second part.

-   Part I Review

<!-- @ref(struc) -->

Part I introduces the Travel-Urban form studies in recent years. As the essential elements of regression analysis, independent variables of Urban Form and dependent variables of Travel are presented using two separate chapters.

Section 2 of Urban Form starts from a fundamental question: What is the relationship between urban form and travel? How strong is the relationship? Then the significant influencing factors in literature are systematically introduced.

Aggregated and disaggregated data at various Spatial Scales can sway the meaning of influencing factors. Units and spatial scales should be carefully chosen to ensure the results match the initial research questions.

Section 3, the theories of travel behavior can be divided into Traveler Choice and Human Mobility by looking at travel as an object or subject. These theories and practice can enrich the understanding of travel variables as the model's response.

Section 4 presents several common model structures in the existing literature of this field. It demonstrates the different perspectives of the relationship between urban form and travel. Some new trends and methods are also included in this chapter.

-   Literature Selection

Three ways are used to identify the related literature. They are database searching, snowball, backward, and forward-searching (Figure \@ref(fig:lit)). Database searching compares several data sources such as Proquest, Web of Science, WorldCat, and Google Scholar. The search range only includes peer-reviewed articles because previous works found grey literature quite disagree on methods. The literature before 2000 is not included because the popularity of computers and relevant software was very limited more than 20 years ago. The keywords set chooses three groups. The first group must include at least one of "travel," "trip," "ridership," and "transit." The second group must contain at least one of "built environment," "land use," and "urban form." The third group must have at least one from "relationship," "association," and "connection." The multiple searches include some restrictive words such as "driving," "distance," "VMT" to reduce the number of results. Or adding some synonyms to enlarge the scopes such as "public transport", "frequency", "mode choice", "model split", etc. Several keywords of travel categorize the final results. For example, the results of "transit/public transport" and "urban form/land use/built environment" are 1716. Compared with @astonExploringBuiltEnvironment2021 's 8779 initial searching results for transit, these numbers are conservative and feasible.

The snowball method starts from @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010 's paper, a most influencing article about travel-urban form studies. Since 2010, there have been four more published meta-analyses on this topic [@stevensDoesCompactDevelopment2017; @gimRelationshipsLandUse2013; @astonStudyDesignImpacts2020; @astonExploringBuiltEnvironment2021]. Every meta-analysis tries to collect as many as possible related papers and give careful screening. Hence, choosing the five meta-analyses as the core collection efficiently identifies the relevant literature. Then the backward searching based on the five meta-analyses gets more than 200 studies of travel-urban form. The backward searching can disclose how much impact the core papers make. But citing the core papers doesn't mean that study should be included. The author might just want to quote an outcome from previous studies.

Therefore, this review is based on the main set of over 200 published papers by backward searching of the core collection. The results of database searching is a reference set. Separately searching also adds some articles when the main set cannot cover specific topics such as non-linear, machine learning, etc. Of course, some literature about statistical methods is also included in this review.

-   Content Organization

Part II presents some statistical methods relating to travel-urban form models. The standard statistical tools applied in travel-urban form studies are some fundamental approaches had been developed for decades. But are these principles and algorithms correctly applied in travel-urban form models? What else can untapped potential be unraveled to eliminate the bias or improve the accuracy?

Chapter 2 introduces the main steps of modeling. When fitting a travel-urban form model, the first step is to choose a suitable model genre. The different travel variables such as distance, frequency, and mode choice decide which type of models should be applied. The variable selection step then figures out what urban-form variables and other factors should be involved in the model. Next, there are several types of outcomes by fitted models. Correctly interpreting the outcomes is important for policy implication. <!-- always give some outcomes. explain the type of model's outcomes and their meaning. --> <!--The reliable outcomes require the models to be valid, adequate, and 'healthy.' -â€“> <!-- Section 3 lists several potential issues which often be neglected or omitted in travel-urban form models.  -->

Chapter 3 presents three special effects: interaction, spatial, and non-linear. In recent years, researchers have tried new approaches to address the shortcomings in previous travel-urban form studies that can inspire future work.

The last chapter, Meta-Analysis, introduces some basic ideas and approaches of meta-analysis and how to deal with publication bias. Scholars don't anticipate all studies will have the same results, especially for the association between travel and urban form. But they want to eliminate the bias and see a more generalized result.
