## Background

In the past decades, efforts have been made to reduce automobile dependency in developed and developing counties. The negative externalities of automobile dependency include, but are not limited to, congestion, collision, unhealthy lifestyle, urban sprawl, social segmentation, pollution, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Many researchers have found that moderating car use has positive social, economic, and environmental impacts.

Urban planners use policies and planning tools such as UBG and TOD to achieve this goal. The underlying logic is that urban-form factors can impact people's travel. If urban form representing a series of long-standing environmental elements can encourage travelers to drive less, take more public transit, or choose active modes voluntarily, these policies and tools would have substantial ecological and social benefits.

Researchers need to address two missions on this topic.
The first one is to prove this relationship between travel and urban form is genuine and estimate the effect sizes.
Such as, does this relationship exist significantly?
Which factors of urban form have a more substantial impact on travel?
Moreover, the effects on individuals and society could have distinctive meanings. <-! what does this sentence mean?-->
The effects might be strong in some cities but weak in others.
A convincing conclusion requires summarizing the results generated from various data sources and categorizing different types of studies.

The second mission is to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.
It is more challenging because many socio-economic and built-environment factors are changing simultaneously and interact with each other in real life.
The causal inference is the weakness of observational studies on travel-urban form relationship.
Although some studies try to account for the self-selection issues, it is hard to prove one intervention must have an expected result.

Another challenge is to balance the costs and benefits and make sure the positive profit for the public interest.
For example, increasing the road network density in a built-up area could be expensive.
Is it worth exchanging the benefit of less driving?
Would there be a net gain to the public as a whole?

There are more practical considerations in policy implementation, such as public will and equity issues.
Increasing residential density in the suburbs often raises serious objections and becomes unfeasible.
The disadvantaged groups could bear a disproportionate burden of urban form changes.
Some researchers suggest thinking about the paradigm shift from mobility to accessibility or reforming the urban transportation system and travel demand management.
These ideas reflect that travel behavior is a curious hybrid of objective physical movement and subjective social-cultural reality.
As Max Weber mentioned in *Objectivity in Social Science* (1904), "the knowledge of social laws is not knowledge of social reality but is rather one of the various aids used by our minds for attaining this end." These issues are beyond the scope of positivism and concern about value and belief.

For the above reason, this paper places the limits on the first mission. 
It will look at how previous studies identify and interpret the relationship between travel and urban form, think how to improve the modeling, and prepare for future studies on the effectiveness.
It will also focus on the U.S. context for controlling the effects of historical, cultural, and political environment among different countries.

## Literature clusters

Four clusters' literature is involved in Part I of this paper (Figure \@ref(fig:fields)).
Urban study and transportation are two primary clusters with large amounts of published articles relating to travel-urban form topics.
A "milestone" paper, @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010 's meta-analysis, is selected as the start point.
And four more meta-analyses are found using the 'snowball' method.
The advantage of choosing meta-analysis is that they all select as relevant studies on this topic as possible.
These meta-analyses also make careful screening to ensure the selected studies have common properties and have high quality.
In this way, over 200 studies are identified ( 62 in @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010, 39 in @gimRelationshipsLandUse2013; 37 in @stevensDoesCompactDevelopment2017, 146 in @astonStudyDesignImpacts2020, 187 in @astonExploringBuiltEnvironment2021).

The third cluster is the studies of human mobility in geography.
Similarly, in another milestone study, @barbosaHumanMobilityModels2018 review 422 articles on relevant models and applications.
Although scholars in urban transportation are familiar with Gravity models and some other methods, the geographic perspective can broaden our horizons and can offer valuable insight into the travel pattern as a whole.

Meanwhile, the fourth cluster, theories in psychology, opens another window for travel studies.
People are not machines. There is a large part of travel behavior cannot be explained by the objective factors.
Fully understanding the individual's action has to look for some psychological reasons.
Here select a few classical theories of travelers' choice.
The purpose is to see a big picture of travel behavior and realize the limitation of geographic and engineering perspectives.

## Content Organization


Part I introduces the theories and framework of travel-urban form studies in recent years.
urban-form factors as the independent variables and travel as the dependent variables are the essential elements of regression analysis. 
The two groups are presented using two separate sections.

Section 2 of Urban Form starts from a fundamental question: What is the influencing direction between urban form and travel?
The significant influencing urban-form factors in literature then are systematically introduced.
This section also notes the scale issues.
Aggregated and disaggregated data at various spatial scales can sway the meaning of influencing factors.
Units and spatial scales should be carefully chosen to ensure the results match the initial research questions.

Section 3 introduce the theories of travel behavior and patterns.
Traveler Choice is looked as a subject in psychology.
While the theories of Human Mobility in geography look at the travel pattern as an object.
These theories and practice can enrich the understanding of travel variables as the model's response.

Section 4 presents several common model structures in the existing literature of this field.
It demonstrates the different perspectives of the relationship between urban form and travel.
