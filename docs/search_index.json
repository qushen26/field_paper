Daily Driving Distance as the variable of interest, is associated with many factors including urban form variables. The discussion will gradually narrow down to the association between driving distance and urban density. Instead of using very high dimension model or synthesized index, Population Density itself may have more potential to explain the driving distance than people ever thought about. Part II introduces the linear, generalized linear, and non-linear models which is the fundamental methods for the question raised in Part I. Meta-analysis is also a useful method to get more general results based on many studies with the same topic. It can be applied on investigating self-selection and publication bias.

Many research have found that moderating the car use have positive social, economic and environmental impacts. The negative externalities of automobile include, but are not limited to, congestion, collision, unhealthy lifestyle, urban sprawl, social segmentation, pollution, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In urban planning and transportation, achieving this goal requires two parts. First, researcher find a set of factors which could mostly explain and affect travel behavior. Second, planning and policy are made to intervene the adjustable factors then to reduce the car use significantly. This paper focuses on the first part and aims at supporting the second part. 1.2 Analytical Framework Regression Analysis provides a powerful framework for explaining the relationship between urban form and travel. A large mount of studies use regression models to identify the influencing factors and evaluate the effect size. Previous research demonstrated that there is not a single factor determining travel behavior. When choosing continues response, like Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT),3 the basic structure of the regression model is as below: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) are the variable of VMT. \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) are all relevant covariates with corresponding coefficients \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). \\(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\) are a random error terms with expected value of \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). When the response is categorical variable, such as binary data of driving versus not, polytomous data of mode choice, or count data of trip frequency, the proper model is: \\[\\begin{equation} E[\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{X}]=\\mu=g^{-1}(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(E[\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{X}]\\) is the expected value of individual/household-level travel variable \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) conditional on \\(\\mathbf{X}\\); \\(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is a linear combination (Ditto.); \\(g(\\cdot)\\) is a link function. 1.3 Content Organization As the essential parts of regression analysis, independent variables of Urban Form and dependent variables of Travel are presented using two separate chapters. Chapter 2 of Urban Form starts from a fundamental question: Do urban form and travel have casual relationship? If not, what is their relationship? Then the significant influencing factors in literature are systematically introduced. Spatial Scales is a critical element which can sway the meaning of influencing factors. Careless choosing variable in various scales could even make the results mismatching the initial research questions. Chapter 3, the theories of travel behavior can be divided into Traveler Choice and Human Mobility by looking travel as object or subject. These theories and practice can enrich the understanding of travel variable as response of model. Chapter 4 presents several common model structures in existing literature of this field. It demonstrate the different perspectives of the relationship between urban form and travel. Some new trends and methods are also included in this chapter. or Vehicle Kilometers Traveled (VKT)↩︎ "],["form.html", "Chapter 2 Urban Form as Predictors 2.1 Influencing Direction 2.2 Influencing Factors 2.3 Spatial Scales 2.4 Summary", " Chapter 2 Urban Form as Predictors The concepts of ‘urban form,’ ‘built environment,’ and ‘land use’ are often exchangeable in literature. Adopted from some common usages, here land use refer to At the macro scale,, The same thing is about ‘land use’ and at the meso and micro scales. and 2.1 Influencing Direction Before discussing the impact of land use on travel, the first question is, does land use characteristics is the treatment affecting the outcome of travel behavior? Or the affecting direction is opposite? Technically, randomized experiments can identify the causal relationship between them. But in real life, it is impossible to setup some experimental areas and randomly assign people to live in these areas. Another way is to observe the dynamic of these factors to figure out the direction of influences. Muller (2004) reviews the evolution of the U.S. urban form and describe the four eras of intrametropolitan growth (Figure ) in U.S. history: the walking-horsecar era (1800s – 1890s), the electric streetcar or transit era (1890s – 1920s), the recreational automobile era (1930s – 1950s), and the freeway era (1950s – 2010s) (Rodrigue, Comtois, and Slack 2016). Each of the four-stage urban transportation development has its dominated spatial structure, which is hard represented by other socio-economic concepts. Each era has the distinctive travel mode, range of distance, and land-use patterns. People can see that the innovation of transportation technology is a determining constraint to other factors and a main driving force to launch the next era. Figure 2.1: One Hour Commuting According to Different Urban Transportation Modes. Source: P.Hugill (1995), World Trade since 1431, p. 213. New transportation tools shifted people’s travel modes, extended travel distance, and reshaped the urban form. In causal inference, the new tools is called confounder or common cause who affect both treatment and outcome. But what is the relationship between travel and land use? A simple way is to observe the sequence fo events to happen. In each transition period, the new tools and new modes began ahead of the new urban development. Even today multiple travel modes exist in old town but suburban seldom has old mode like streetcar. Thus, land use is more like a outcome rather than treatment. However, the urban form remains relatively more stable than individual’s travel behavior in each era. A family may be used to driving in Texas and turn to use the subway when they move to New York and vice versa. Given a period, VMT could be affected by density and other factors. It doesn’t make sense that VMT will change the density in the short term. Therefore, land use can be treated as indepedent variables in the context of the current stage of urban development. The relationship of land use with respect to travel can hold for a period of time. Over the long term, the relationships among travel, land use, and other physical, socioeconomic, demographic factors were interactive and iterative. D. M. Levinson and Krizek (2018) emphasize transportation is a necessary but not a sufficient factor for any development. The change of eras is a comprehensive outcome of socioeconomic and technological development. Which factor caused which effect does not have a simple answer. A conservative view is that land use and travel behavior are determined simultaneously by the transportation costs (Pickrell 1999). Although randomized experiments about travel and land use are impossible, once the simultaneous relationship holds, the regression model still can explore the associations between travel and land use. 2.2 Influencing Factors For the complexity of travel behavior, many objective or subjective factors could change people’s travel decisions. They include but are not limited to physical, socio-demographic, individual, and policy determinants. It seems impossible to make an exhaustive list. Here briefly introduces several significant influencing factors. A dichotomy of individual versus environmental factors is a common framework. All relevant factors involving personal or household characteristics is treated as internal factors. While the built-environment and other environmental factors have external influences. Disaggregate analysis usually chooses this structure because the models can distinguish the different sources of variation from individual and environmental factors. Take for example VMT models, the model is as follow. \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{I}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{I}+\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{E}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{E}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{I}\\) are travelers’ internal characteristics; \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{E}\\) are built environment and other environment covariates. 2.2.1 Individual Factors Previous research have identified many internal factors such as employment status, income level, lifecycle stage, habits, and preferences, having strong impact on travel. Therefore, a sufficient model should contain these influencing factors. One purpose is to increase the explanatory power. Another purpose is to control self-selection and other independent variables. Some major life events, such as transitions to higher school, labor market, marriage, parenthood, retirement, and relocation, could provide windows of opportunity for travel behavior change (Larouche et al. 2020). The results of a scoping review show that relocation prompts people to reflect on their travel behaviors. Entry into the labor market often increases driving while retirement may have more walking or cycling for fewer time constraints. The effects of school transition may have different directions due to the environmental differences. Marriage is not significant because couples may live together before marriage. In a similar way, parents may have more car use several years after childbirth for the purposes of childcare, school, recreation, etc. Income levels Vehicle ownership Working status Major life events/lifecycle Psychological factors Attitude Habit 2.2.2 Environmental Factors Environmental factors usually impact a large number of people. Three main categories are socio-economic environment, natural Environment, and built environment. The natural terrain, temperature, and precipitation could change travelers’ choice. These factors can only be examined across cities and regions. They are also hard to change and are not included in the models. Fuel price, crime rates also encourage people choosing driving or not for economic or safety reasons. Some factors could be related to the broader topics such as public security, and Automobile Dependency may be the secondary issues in some cases. Or, Some of them are as hard to measure and control as individual psychological factors, such as car culture. Infrastructure supplement is also a set of strong explanatory variables. It has been proven that road capacity and parking space are two primary factors for driving. No one doubts this relations. The problem is that reducing supply is painful for public and is subject to political pressure. Policy environment as treatment applied on a administrative region, such as restrictions on car use, can only be examined by comparing with the ‘control groups.’ Meanwhile, transportation policy is a context-dependent factor. The same policy in name may be implemented in very different ways across the country. Cross-sectional study is a challenge because existing the complex interaction effects between a policy and the characteristics of the ‘experimental group.’ Longitudinal study and Difference in Difference (DID) methods are more common in policy evaluations. There are also two types of policies. Travel Demand Management (TDM) heads directly toward change of travel behavior. While many urban development policies such as UBG, TOD, and rezoning have more comprehensive goals. The research purpose of travel behavior is not only to explain travel itself, but also to find some tools to affect people’s behavior. Built environment is the primary focus of attention in urban studies because policy or planning might be able to intervene current and future land use, further achieve the goal of travel behavior change. “Attributes of the built environment influence travel by making travel to opportunities more or less convenient and attractive” (Domencich and McFadden 1975; D. M. Levinson, Marshall, and Axhausen 2017; Litman 2017). Some of them such as urban density and design are more acceptable for having neutral meaning and could change people’s behavior inadvertently. Some such as transit services are more welcome and feasible through providing a substitution of driving. There are many complex unknown interaction effects between built-environment and other variables. Some research found that the habit discontinuity hypothesis, major life events may provide windows of opportunity during which individuals may reconsider their travel behaviors and be more sensitive to behavior change interventions (Verplanken et al. 2008). Similarly, ‘changes in built environment attributes may be particularly salient for behavior change following relocation.’ Comparing to other factors, built environment are more measurable to be added into the regression model. Detailed introduction will be placed in the next section. 2.2.3 Density Density is the first built-environment factor added to the model. Early research of automobile trips and urban density can go back sixty years (Mitchell and Rapkin 1954). H. S. Levinson and Wynn (1963) suggest that the people who lived in high-density neighborhoods make fewer automobile trips. This argument stimulated an enormous volume of work. Although later studies construct more complex models, density factor stays in most of built environment-travel model even today. The most influential aggregate studies start from Newman and Kenworthy. They published a series of studies to show a strong negative correlation between per capita fuel use and gross population density (GPD).4 Their sample covers from thirty-two to fifty-eight global cities (P. G. Newman and Kenworthy 1989a; P. Newman and Kenworthy 2015) and produced very convincing results. Their research points out the relationship rather than estimating the effect size. In this way, the denser cities have less fuel consumption, which implies less automobile dependence. This is a succinct argument and is widely accepted by planners and policy makers. The criticisms include their ideological grounds, dataset, and model specification5. A criticism is that, for aggregated data, the population variable on both sides of the equation artificially creates a hyperbolic function (Equation (2.1)). In many disaggregated studies, the effects of density are not significant and have a small magnitude. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} &amp; \\text{VMT}_{average} =\\beta\\cdot \\text{Density} +\\cdots\\\\ \\implies &amp; \\frac{\\text{VMT}_{total}}{\\text{Population}} = \\beta\\cdot \\frac{\\text{Population}}{\\text{Area}} +\\cdots\\\\ \\implies &amp; \\text{VMT}_{total} = \\beta\\cdot \\frac{(\\text{Population})^2}{\\text{Area}} +\\cdots \\end{split} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Another criticism argues that the global comparisons are not valid, such as comparing Hong Kong and Houston. Reid Ewing et al. (2018) created a subset with only US Metropolitan areas from Jeffrey R. Kenworthy and Laube (1999) ‘s original data set. They fit the same model but get a much lower \\(R^2\\) (0.096) than Kenworthy and Laube’s (0.72). A similar work by Fanis (2019) shows the low \\(R^2\\) for US cities (0.1838) and European cities (0.2804) when deconstructing Newman and Kenworthy’s data by continent. Actually, any research question has its corresponding sampling design. Choosing a cutoff from the whole data often gets a different result. These criticisms are unfair for Kenworthy and Laube’s work. But it is true that the US cities have higher VMT and lower density than other countries’ cities. Recent evidence over a 20-year period from other cities and counties show that the status quo of the U.S. only represents a small window of the global trend(Jeffrey R. Kenworthy 2017). Density variable have some advantages. Density is calculated by population size and area size from census data, which are widely available over the country. In contrast, some individual variables are not as measurable and accurate as density. Some studies found density might be an intermediate variable or proxy to other land use variables such as land use mix, street network, and transit services (Reid Ewing and Cervero 2010; Handy 2005). The divisions of the statistical units in the U.S. are from an uniform criteria at multiple scales. Thus, density values is more objective, and comparable comparing other measurements. Density is an informative factor. Except for the mean and variance, The moments function for Urban density such as skewness, kurtosis, or rank, all can be the predictor candidates. Scolar also explore more delicate measurements of density such as Propotional Weighted Density to replace overall density. “population-weighted density is equal to conventional density plus the variance of density across the subareas used for its calculation divided by the conventional density” (Ottensmann 2018). Some studies use a geographically weighted regression (GWR)6 procedure to identify significant employment density peaks. Urban density can be represented by many approximate variables – built-up density, residential density, employment density, destination density, or CBD density. Here this paper focus on population density – how many people live in a square mile of land - and involves others if possible. 2.2.4 D-variables One trenchant criticism of Newman and Kenworthy’s work is that the univariate or bivariate models may leave some critical factors out. In a recent debate (Fanis 2019), Newman clarified that “All our work shows that there are multiple causes of car dependence and multiple implications.” Since travel behavior is a multi-dimensional issue, more socio-demographic and built environment variables were added to the multivariate analysis. The work started from adding three ‘Ds’ variables, density, diversity, and design (Cervero and Kockelman 1997), extended to five ‘Ds,’ adding destination accessibility and distance to transit (Reid Ewing and Cervero 2001). It even grows to seven with the addition of demand management and demographics (TODO). Ds’ Framework is a significance-centered mixed factor sets and becomes one of the most influential ideas among the built environment–travel literature in the past decades. Using household-level or person-level data, these studies tried to disclose more complex relationships among the candidate factors by adding more relevant variables. The criticism from Handy (2018) says the 5Ds variables may not be independent. A meta-analysis found that spatial multicollinearity is widespread in this field (Gim 2013). Although previous studies usually check multicollinearity issues, these variables still correlate with each other in some ways and may have strong interaction effects. 2.2.5 Synthesized Index To address the multicollinearity and interactions issues, Clifton (2017) suggest to convert the various environmental characteristics to built environment indices. Some research try to use ‘compactness indices’ to replace the single density measurement.7 The primary method is principal components analysis (PCA) or principal components regression (PCR), which synthesizes many variables to four dimensions: development density, land use mix, activity centering, and street connectivity. The advantage of this method is to increase the elasticity value significantly. A recent study shows that the elasticity of VMT with respect to a county compactness index is -0.78. The disadvantage of this method is that the internal mechanisms of the indices are still not clear. Another disadvantage is that the various indices are not comparable. For example, the Urban Liveability Index (ULI) by Higgs et al. (2019) includes many indicators supporting health and wellbeing. The association between ULI and travel mode choice is a specific result unless it is widely applied on other studies and cities. A smart application of synthesize method (common factor analysis) is to control the physiological effects in models. Hong, Shen, and Zhang (2014) convert eight attitudinal questions in the 2006 Household Activity Survey to three factors: Ease, Convenience, and Pro-transit. They fit the model using two geographic scales: 1-km buffer and traffic analysis zone (TAZ). After contolling the attitudinal effects, the nonresidential density and distance from CBD have significant effects on VMT at the TAZ level. 2.2.6 Meta-Aanalysis To get a general, comparable outcome, Reid Ewing and Cervero (2010) collect more than 200 related studies and try to summarize the elasticity values using meta-analysis. Elasticity measures the percentage change in response with respect to a 1 percent increase in a predictor. Thus, it is a dimensionless parameter. After screening, sixty-two studies were selected. But divided by modes (VMT, walking, and transit use), only nine studies were used to calculate the weighted-average elasticities of VMT with respect to population density. Of nine papers, six gave zero or insignificant elasticity, while three showed significant negative values (two are -0.04 and one is -0.12). The weighted-average elasticity of job density (sample size = 9) was zero. The largest elasticity of VMT belonged to Destination accessibility, -0.20 with respect to Job accessibility by auto (sample size = 5) and -0.22 with respect to Distance to downtown (sample size = 3). Due to the small sample size, the confidence intervals were not available. The authors call for more relevant studies to refine the results. Stevens (2017a) also try to explain the different outcomes using a meta-regression method. Based on the results from 37 studies, they found the magnitude of effects is small and suggest that compacting development has a tiny influence on driving. His work triggers a new round of discussion (Handy 2017; Knaap, Avin, and Fang 2017; Nelson 2017; Manville 2017; Clifton 2017) In Reid Ewing and Cervero (2017) ‘s reply, they agreed with the values of elasticity but emphasize that Stevens’ results (-0.15 ~ -0.22) are not small actually. In a forthcoming study by Ewing and Cervero, an update elasticity of VMT per capita with respect to density is -0.15 (Reid Ewing et al. 2018). In Stevens (2017b) ’s response to commentaries , he clarified the research goals and important questions. After the two milestones for meta-analysis of built environment and travel behavior, a recent update re-examines the post-2010 empirical literature and summarized the most common factors (Aston et al. 2021). They are Density, Urban design, Local land use mix, mono/polycentrism and centrality, and Regional jobs-housing balance 2.3 Spatial Scales Due to the various data sources or research interests, built environment-travel studies divide into two groups. One group uses aggregated travel and built-environment variables at the city, county, or metropolitan level. At the same time, the other group uses trip data at the individual or household level. Research also find that the models at different scales would give different result. This phenomenon is called Modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). Previous studies found that the density variables evaluated at different spatial scales have different impact on travel (Boarnet and Crane 2001; Buchanan et al. 2006; Sultana and Weber 2007). It is not reasonable to neglect the scale issues in built environment-travel studies. 2.3.1 Neighborhood Scale In disaggregate analysis, the travel records by individual or household are the basic unit of dependent variables. traveler’s socio-demographic characteristics also keep this resolution such as income and vehicle ownership. However, built environment factors technically have a minimum geographic unit as the measure scope. Census tract and block group are the most common unit in disaggregate analysis. Scholars who choose disaggregate analysis believe that the internal difference of urban characteristics be neglected at region level. They are interested in the impact of meso-level built-environment factors like the population and employment distribution of intra-urban. Using disaggregate data can disclose the neighborhood-level differences and eliminate aggregation bias. Using logarithms of VMTs per vehicle from National Personal Travel Survey (NPTS) data with 114 urban areas, Bento et al. (2005) fit the linear model with 19 variables. They found that, instead of population density, population centrality has a significant effect on VMT. The elasticity of annual VMT with respect to population centrality is 1.5.8 The results of travel models at different scales are often inconsistent. Using the same data source, Reid Ewing et al. (2018) found that the elasticities of VMT with respect to population density is -0.164 in the aggregate models, which is a much higher value than disaggregate studies (-0.04 in the meta-analysis of Reid Ewing and Cervero (2010)). They suspect that this phenomenon is aggregation bias or ecological fallacy. They further explain that the two scales represent two different questions: The metropolitan-level density, which strongly affects the VMT, is not equivalent to the neighborhood density, which has much weaker effects on VMT. 2.3.2 Urban/Region Scale Tradition of aggregate analysis treat a city or metropolitan as an observation. Both dependent and independent variables are aggregated at macro level. Here the land use factors only reflect the density, pattern and structure at the whole city. Coevering and Schwanen (2006) carry on Newman and Kenworthy’s work and consider four sets of potential explanatory variables: ten of urban form, six of transport service, five of housing and development history, and thirteen of socio-economic situations. They fit some linear regression models (all the variables keep the initial magnitude without taking logarithm or other transformation) and all of their adjusted \\(R^2\\) are higher than 0.7. Their models also show that the cities with higher population density drive less. They found the land use characteristics of the inner area are more important than metropolitan-wide population density. Similarly, a recent city-level study (Gim 2021) fit multiple regression models based on the data from 65 global cities. The population density becomes not significant in this model. Their results show that fuel price, household size, and congestion level have strong effects on travel time. Using structural equation modeling, they also find the population density of the high-density built-up areas has a larger effect on travel than overall city density. The aggregate models confound the individual level’s variance. Urban form factors usually show significant effect. 2.3.3 Multi-scale Studies Schwanen, Dieleman, and Dijst (2004) explains that many urban form dimensions are tied to specific geographical scales. Recently, more studies import the spatial scales as an explanatory variable. In a report of travel and polycentic development, Reid Ewing et al. (2020) identify 589 centers in 28 U.S. regions. Then a categorical variable, ‘within/outside a center’ is added into the model. The results show that the household living within a center have more walk trips and fewer VMT than who living outside a center. S. Lee and Lee (2020) also conduct a study involving factors at three level: household, census tract, and urbanized area. They find that density and centrality affect VMT at urban level as well as the meso-scale jobs-housing mix. After controlling for factors, the effect of local factors the urban-level spatial structure moderates the effects size of local built environment on travel. 2.3.4 Modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) Early in 1930, scholars noticed that, when a set of smaller areal units was aggregated into larger areal units, the variance structure will be changed and the estimated coefficients will be larger (Gehlke and Biehl 1934). This inconsistency/sensitivity of analysis results is called modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and ecological fallacy (Openshaw 1984). In aggregated analysis, two kinds of MAUP often happen simultaneously (Wong 2004). The first one called ‘scale effect’ means that the correlation among variables depends on the size of areal units. Larger units usually lead to larger estimations. The second one, zone effect describe the various results of correlation by choosing different areal shape or subset at the same scale. Fotheringham and Wong (1991) found that multivariate analysis is unreliable when using the data from areal units. Both value and direction of estimated coefficients may change for different spatial configurations (G. Lee, Cho, and Kim 2016; Xu, Huang, and Dong 2018). Meanwhile, some aggregate studies shows that, using the simple averages of individual data, the estimations of coefficients in linear model are unbiased (Prais and Aitchison 1954). A condition is that the regression model must fix the omission error using proper specification (Amrhein 1995; Ye and Rogerson 2021). The check of unit consistency may help to examine the biases by MAUP on the estimations. 2.4 Summary The factors measured at a specific scale could only explain the variation generated at or above that level. Even some factors such as density has cross scales. Their distributions in different units and scales are not identical. It is reasonable for them to have various meanings and influences on travel. A systematic comparison should be conducted among multi-scale studies. The inconsistent might not be about correct or wrong. As Reid Ewing et al. (2018) commented, the aggregate and disaggregate studies are asking the apples and oranges questions. References "],["travel.html", "Chapter 3 Travel as Response 3.1 Travel Variables 3.2 Traveler Choice 3.3 Human Mobility 3.4 Discussion", " Chapter 3 Travel as Response Two different perspectives, individual and collective, can explain travel behavior and car use. When people contextualizing travel as a personal choice or decision-making, the traveler as a subject make mode choices, driving or not. When travel behavior is understood as a social phenomenon, researcher observe and understand all the trip distance, time, and distributions as a whole. The two perspectives derived two schools of theory, Traveler choice and human mobility. In the school of Traveler choice, travel distance could be treat as an independent variable, a part of travel cost, or could be decided in the next step after mode choice , such as route choice. In the school of human mobility, driving distance grab more attentions. 3.1 Travel Variables Three dimensions can reflect the degree of car use, travel mode, driving frequency, and driving distance. Previous studies commonly choose two metrics for measuring them, the share of auto trips (or other modes) and Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). The share of mode is calculated by dividing the number of chosen mode over the total number of trips. The main travel modes, transit, bicycle, and walking are the alternatives to driving personal car. Given the same amount of travel demand, more active and transit modes means less car use. VMT is used to measure the travel distance made by a private vehicle. An integrated viewpoint is to treat the non-auto trips as zero-VMT. In this way, the probability distribution of VMT can comprehensively represents the travel behavior. The smallest unit of VMT is recorded by trip from a daily travel survey. Then these records can be aggregated to personal or household daily VMT (DVMT). A traveler’s or household’s DVMT can account for the degree of automobile dependency by combining the number of trips and driving distance during a day. Given the survey day is randomly selected, DVMT can reflect the typical travel pattern in general. Although, there are other approaches collect weekly, monthly, or longer VMT records by tracking car usage. The odometer records are more likely to represent the usage of vehicle rather than traveler’s behavior. It is not easy to acquire long-term VMT through survey-based method. The annual mileage and fuel efficiency information provided in some public data usually are estimated values using daily records and are not as accurate as DVMT. On a personal scale, VMT relates to the economic cost of travel by car, while another dimension, travel time measuring the time cost of vehicle travel. For society as a whole, the total VMT measures the usage of road network. Thus, it acts as a major interest within the field of transportation, especially in the research of travel demand and infrastructure capacity. And VMT highly correlated with the amount of fuel consumption, which is one of the main indicators of pollution and GHG emission. Since transportation is the second source of GHG emissions, it is also one of the priority issues involving sustainable development and climate change. Previous research found that reducing VMT is instrumental in solving some urban problems and improving the qualities of urban life. The proportion of transportation cost in household expenditures is about 15 to 25 percent in the U.S. It is natural that urban studies try to figure out the relationship between VMT and some urban built-environment factors. Then urban or regional policies could identify the best practices to contribute VMT reduction. 3.2 Traveler Choice Are ‘decision’ and ‘choice’ the same when discussing travel modes? Literally, a ‘choice’ is one decision given all available options at the same time. While ‘decision’ is a broader concept. A decision could be a schedule with a combination of many choices, such as modes, destination, and activities. A decision related to travel behavior could even include bicycle or car purchase, and relocation. This section will start from the theories of mode choice, then extend to a broader discussion of decision processes. 3.2.1 Rational Choice Theory For prescriptive, analytical everyday decision-making, rationality is a basic assumption in reasoned behavior or rational choice theories (Edwards 1954; Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944). This category is also called ‘Normative Decision Theory,’ which assume people a traveler is an ideal decision maker who are full rational. It requires three necessary steps including information collection, utility evaluation, and choice making. Expected Utility Theory (EUT) Traditional economics focus on the utility evaluation and come up with the Expected Utility Theory (EUT) which is also called Consumer Choice Theory. The rule of EUT is Random Utility Maximization (RUM) (Ben-Akiva and Lerman 1985; McFadden 1973). This classical theory claims that customer always choose the one most appropriate by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of a range of alternatives, evaluating the benefits and costs of each possible outcome. Eventually travelers will select the optimal solution with the maximum ‘utility’ from the choice set. In real life, Rational Choice Theory can not accurately describe the actual human behavior. Individuals do not often collect and analyse all the relevant information. They are not ‘ideal’ and are not able to calculate the utility for all possible alternatives with perfect accuracy. In many cases, the travel decision is not regarded as the ‘best’ one to achieve travelers’ desired objective. Many other theories were developmed to fix these issues. 3.2.2 Bounded Rational Behavior Bounded rationality focused on the limitation of self-control (March and Simon 2005). In reality, individuals are behaving under many constraints including incomplete information, limited time, and cognitive capacity. The observed behaviors often are not optimal and are inconsistent with ‘pure’ rationality. Bounded rationality claims that, when people make decisions under constraints, heuristics and rules of thumb are more common than statistical inference. People are satisfied with a ‘good enough’ decision unless there is a definitively better alternative. The recently witnessed events would have stronger effects on an individual’s decision than others (Camerer, Loewenstein, and Rabin 2004). 3.2.3 Theory of Planned Behavior In psychology, many theories and models are developed to explain people’s decision-making processes.9 Ajzen and Fishbein (1977) proposed the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) to understand people’s behavioral intentions and actual behaviors. They found two deciding psychological elements as attitudes and subjective norms. Ajzen (1991) adds a new part of Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) and renames TRA as Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Attitudes are personal evaluation and it means how people prefer or are against performing an activity. For example, a commuter might choose transit in spite of the longer travel time because this person believes that transit is an environment-friendly transport mode. Subjective norm is the social pressure from others. In the example above, choosing transit is because of other people’s normative expectations rather than personal desirability. PBC represents some nonvolitional factors such as time, budget, and resources. PBC is assessed by the individual’s perception of ease or difficulty of the behavior. PBC is one reason of the different between intentions and actual behaviors, which is called attitude-behavior gap (Kollmuss and Agyeman 2002; Lane and Potter 2007). In this case, a commuter might choose transit because this person is confident in catching the bus every day. Based on RUM models, McFadden (2001) proposes a similar framework called the choice process including attitudes, perception, and preference. This framework is further developed to hybrid choice model (HCM) and non-RUM decision protocols (Ben-Akiva et al. 2002). Two meta-analyses found that intentions to drive, perceived behavioral control, habits and past behavior play the primary roles in travel mode choice. Among these factors, PBC have the strongest effects on private car use. People don’t want to reduce the car use because they think it is very inconvenient. The effect of attitudes is modest while subjective norms have weak effect on car use (Lanzini and Khan 2017; Gardner and Abraham 2008). 3.2.4 Prospect Theory Kahneman and Tversky (1979) introduced the ProspectTheory10 to study the impacts of biases. Prospect Theory is a descriptive theory with three main components: First, people are more sensitive to the sure things (e.g., the probability between 0.9 and 1.0, or between 0.0 and 0.1 ), while being indifferent to the middle range (e.g., from 0.45 to 0.55). Second, people care more about the change of overall proportion than the absolute values regardless of gains or losses. Third, people make choice based on a reference point, rather than the overall situation or worth. Economist also extend the theory of expected utility maximization to Behavioral Economics by address the influence of psychology on human behavior. Regret Theory Regret Theory introduces the notions of risk or uncertainty in decisions (Loomes and Sugden 1982). Psychological studies found that individuals will not only try to maximize the utility but to minimize the anticipation of regret. The fear of regret could affect people’s rational behavior. For example, A high risk of congestion in peak hours could encourage a commuter to choose transit mode. Likewise, a good reputation for punctuality can give traveler confidence in the rail system. In addition to the traditional utility framework, a regret term is added to address the uncertainty resolution. The utility function on the best alternative outcome will be smaller after subtracting the regret term, which is an increasing, continuous and non-negative function. Cognitive Bias Another psychological factor, cognitive bias can result in judgement errors. For example, people treat potential gains and losses differently, that is called Loss Aversion. Loss Aversion suggests that the negative feeling about losses is greater than the positive response to gains (Tversky and Kahneman 1992). As a result, individual’s decisions may not be consistent with evidence and tend to pay additional costs to avoid losses. 3.3 Human Mobility 3.3.1 Trip Distribution Laws In Physics and Geography, travel distance and pattern are treated as an objective phenomenon. There is a long history of human mobility studies. The related theories try to use some statistical expressions to fit the aggregated trip distributions. Gravity Law is a dominant theory in this field. Scholars have developed some more delicate forms of Gravity Law and found some mathematical relationship to other famous distribution laws. Some theories from different perspectives, like intervening opportunities also show strong ability for explaining travel patterns and regularities. 3.3.1.1 Distance Based Theories Law of Migration An early theory called Law of Migration by Ravenstein (1885) tried to explain the regional migration patterns. This found is based on observation rather than quantitative analysis. But it capture the fact that the direction of migration is toward the regional center with great commerce and industry. It also pointed out that distance is a primary factor for migrant. This theory inspired many studies on population movement consequently. Even today, socio-economic factors and distance-constraints are the essential parts in the relevant models and frameworks. Zipf’s Law Zip’s law is also called discrete Pareto distribution. It is found in linguistics to explain the inverse relationship between the frequency and rank of a word. The charm is that this rank-frequency distribution disclosed a universal law in many realms of society and physics, such as urban size, corporation sizes, cells’ transcriptomes and so on. Zipf interpreted the two competing factors as force of diversification and unification. The former produces larger amount of cases and the later tries to upgrade the rank. An equilibrium of the rank-frequency balance is controlled through a parameter \\(\\alpha\\) in the exponent. For example, a city’s population size \\(m\\) has a negative power relationship to its rank \\(r\\) as below.11 \\[ m \\sim 1 / r^{\\alpha} \\] Zipf (1946) extended this expression to describe the traffic in both directions between two cities: \\[ t_{ij}\\propto \\frac{m_i m_j} {d_{ij}} \\] where \\(t_{ij}\\) represent the traffic flow of goods between two centers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) with population sizes \\(m_i\\) and \\(m_j\\). \\(d_{ij}\\) is the distance from \\(i\\) to \\(j\\). Because Zipf’s formula has a same form with Newtonian mechanics (Newton 1848), people call this expression as Gravity Law. Gravity Law As the most influential theory, Gravity Law asserts that the amount of traffic flow between two centers is proportional to the product of their mass and inverse to their distance. The mass is often measured by population size. \\[ p_{ij}\\propto m_i m_j f(d_{ij}), \\qquad i\\ne j \\] where \\(p_{ij}\\) is the probability of commuting between origin \\(i\\) and destination \\(j\\), satisfying \\(\\sum_{i,j=1}^n p_{ij}=1\\). \\(m_i\\) and \\(m_j\\) are the population of two census units. The travel cost between the two places is represented as a distance decay function of \\(d_{ij}\\) . Exponential and power are the two forms of the distance decay function with a parameter \\(\\lambda\\) showed as below: \\[ f(d_{ij})=\\exp(-\\lambda d_{ij}) \\] and \\[ f(d_{ij})={d_{ij}}^{-\\lambda} \\] The function implies that the movements between the origin and destination decays with their distance. In transportation modeling, a common form of gravity model is : \\[ T_{ij}= \\alpha_i O_i \\cdot \\beta_j D_j \\cdot f(d_{ij}) \\] where \\(T_{ij}\\) is the flow between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). the two population are replaced by total tirp generation of origin \\(O_i\\) and total trip attraction of destination \\(D_i\\). \\(\\alpha_i\\) and \\(\\beta_j\\) are two constraining parameters to satisfy \\(\\sum_{i}^{n_i}T_{ij} = D_j\\) and \\(\\sum_{j}^{n_j}T_{ij} = O_i\\). It means that \\(\\alpha_i = [\\sum_{j}^{n_j} \\beta_j D_j \\cdot f(d_{ij})]^{-1}\\) and \\(\\beta_j = [\\sum_{i}^{n_i} \\alpha_i O_i \\cdot f(d_{ij})]^{-1}\\). Thus, this model is called as doubly constrained gravity model. If it relieves the two constrains. this model will be simplified to single-constrained and unconstrained gravity model. By assuming \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) is an adjustment parameter irrelevant to locations \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) for controlling the total flows, this model will not guarantee that the attraction of a destination equals the sum of flow from all origins, and the generation of a origin equals the sum of flow to all destinations. Power Law Broadly speaking, Zipf’s law and Gravity Law have a common essence of power law, or scaling pattern. The Zipfian distribution is one of a family of power-law probability distributions. The power-law distribution also holds in many realms: urban size, population density, street blocks, building heights, etc. The state-of-the-art studies of human mobility agree that travel behavior follows a power-law distribution at the population level (Barbosa et al. 2018). An example is Brockmann, Hufnagel, and Geisel (2006) use dollar bills to track travel habits and confirm this theory. It reflects the fact that both trip and land use, as two geographic variables, follow some Paretian-like distribution. Apparently, it conflicts with Gaussian thinking, the foundation frame of linear models based on the location and scale parameters.12 Meanwhile, the log-normal distribution may be asymptotically equivalent to a special case of Zipf’s law, which could support the logarithm transform in current VMT-density models (Saichev, Malevergne, and Sornette 2010). 3.3.1.2 Opportunity Based Theories Law of Intervening Opportunities Law of Intervening Opportunities by Stouffer (1940) developed the migration theory in a different direction. Stouffer proposed that “the number of people going a given distance is directly proportional to the number of opportunities at that distance and inversely proportional to the number of intervening opportunities.” Comparing with gravity law, the number of intervening opportunities \\(s_{ij}\\) replaces the distance between origin and destination. For example, a resident living in location \\(i\\) is attracted to location \\(j\\) with \\(s_{ij}\\) job opportunities in between. \\[ p_{ij}\\propto m_i \\frac{P(1|m_i,m_j,s_{ij})}{\\sum_{k=1}^n P(1|m_i,m_j,s_{ij})}, \\qquad i\\ne j \\] where the conditional probability \\(P(1|m_i,m_j,s_{ij})\\) can be expressed by Schneider (1959) as: \\[ P(1|m_i,m_j,s_{ij})=\\exp[-\\gamma s_{ij}] - \\exp[-\\gamma (m_j + s_{ij})] \\] Radiation Law Simini et al. (2012) propose a radiation model express the probability of the destination \\(j\\) absorbing a person living in location \\(i\\) as below: \\[ P(1|m_i,m_j,s_{ij})= \\frac{m_i m_j}{(m_i + s_{ij})(m_i + m_j + s_{ij})} \\] Or in transportation model it is expressed as: \\[ T_{ij}= O_i\\cdot\\frac{m_i m_j}{(m_i + s_{ij})(m_i + m_j + s_{ij})} \\] To approximating the number of opportunities, \\(s_{ij}\\) is from the population within a circle centered at origin. The radius is the distance between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). Then \\(m_i + m_j + s_{ij}\\) represents the total population within the circle, and \\(m_i + s_{ij}\\) is the total population within the circle but excluding \\(j\\), that is: \\[ T_{ij}= O_i\\cdot\\frac{m_i }{m_i + s_{ij}}\\cdot\\frac{m_j}{m_i + m_j + s_{ij}} \\] The part of fraction converts to the product of two weights, the weights of origin and destination in the whole region. Although distance \\(d_{ij}\\) doesn’t appear in the expression of radiation model, it is still a determinant as in gravity model. Distance Decay (hazard models) Using the survival analysis framework, Yang et al. (2014) further extended this model by assuming a trip from origin to destination as a time-to-event process. Here time variable is replaced by the number of opportunities. The survival function \\(S(t)=Pr(T&gt;t)\\) represents the cumulative probability of the event not happened within a certain amount of opportunities. Choosing Weibull distribution as the survival function, \\(S(t)=\\exp[-\\lambda t^\\alpha]\\) with scale parameter \\(\\lambda \\in (0, +\\infty)\\). By assuming \\(f(\\lambda)=\\exp[-\\lambda]\\) and integral on \\(\\lambda\\), the derivation is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.1} \\begin{split} P(T&gt;t)=&amp;E\\{\\exp[-\\lambda t^\\alpha]\\} \\\\ =&amp;\\int_0^{+\\infty}\\exp[-\\lambda t^\\alpha]\\exp[-\\lambda]d\\lambda\\\\ =&amp;\\frac{1}{1+t^{\\alpha}} \\end{split} \\end{equation}\\] By replacing \\(t\\) with \\(m_i+s_{ij}\\), the conditional probability is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} P(1|m_i,m_j,s_{ij})= &amp;\\frac{P(T&gt;m_i+s_{ij})-P(T&gt; m_i+s_{ij}+m_j)}{P(T&gt;m_i)} \\\\ =&amp;\\frac{[(m_i + s_{ij} + m_j)^{\\alpha}-(m_i + s_{ij})^{\\alpha}](m_i^{\\alpha}+1)}{[(m_i + s_{ij} + m_j)^{\\alpha}+1][(m_i + s_{ij})^{\\alpha}+1]}\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is a parameter adjusting the effect of the number of job opportunities between origins and destinations. A similar method can be found in Ding, Mishra, et al. (2017) ’s study. They use a multilevel hazard model to examine the effects of TAZ level and individual level factors with respect to commuting distance using the data of Washington metropolitan area. Based on commuting data from six countries, Lenormand, Bassolas, and Ramasco (2016) found gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities law. The reasons could be the circle with radius \\(d_{ij}\\) can not accurately represent the real influencing area, and the different between population and opportunities is not captured in this way. 3.3.2 Time Geography In contrast to overall trip distribution, the movements of individuals are always research interest in geography. Hägerstraand (1970) proposed some concepts and tools in space and time to measure and understand the individual trajectories. This branch is called time geography. The famous “space-time aquarium/prism” is a 3D cube by adding temporal scales on the geographic space. It can capture the detailed structure and behavior of traveler. A daily travel could include multiple trips and form a travel chain. The traveler may switch the sequence or adjust the routes to optimize the chain and minimize the travel costs. The daily total travel distance is the summation of every trip distances. The number of trips denotes as trip count. It exists but not so common that driving itself is the travel purpose, especially in daily life. At individual level, time geography borrows some physical and mathematical concept and methods such as random walk, Brownian motion, and Levy flight Along with the wide usage of Global Positioning System (GPS), high performance computer, and sophisticated algorithms, the high-resolution data being collected. The relevant studies also have a dramatic increase after 2005. 3.4 Discussion The theories of travel behavior follow a positivism tradition for a long time. Economics and geography give some strong explanations for both macro and micro travel patterns. In order to remove the limitation of ideal rationality, more sociological and psychological theories and methods are introduced into this field. Gradually, people realized the normative concept is not sufficient for real world applications. More descriptive and narrative arguments appear in transportation and land use planning. An example is the shift from mobility to accessibility. A primary trend in urban and transportation fields recently is the transition from techno-centric to socio-centric (Lanzini &amp; Stochetti, 2020)13 The socio-centric methods claim that accessibility is the key concept for evaluating urban sustainable mobility. This trend emphasizes the interpretations of travel behavior are context dependent and avoids generalizations. Research in human mobility insist the positivism methodology and has some significant contributions because the individuals differences are confounded at the macro level. Under this framework, geographic distance always plays a prominent role in all human mobility theories. In adding to travel distance and Origin-Destination Matrices, Some primary metrics such as Mean Square Displacement and Radius of gyration are defined to quantitatively describe travel behaviors A vital insight is that human behavior has two mobility roles: explorers and returners. It might be an inherent property of society, the instinct of exploring more territory and keeping together for division of labor. The explorers’ behavior is consistent with the theory of utility maximization. People are always looking for more benefit. The concept of habit also match the behavior of ‘preferential return,’ which means people are natural or nurtured likely to return to frequently visited locations or recently-visited locations. Both gravity and opportunities theory choose population size as the source of travel demand. This is a rough assumption and is not enough to get more accurate predictions. One solution is to use empirical observed demand to calibrate the model case by case. Another way is to find more suitable variables such as residential, employment, or activity size to improve the model. When area of interest is intra-urban, the O-D matrix records the trip connections among all paired locations. The matrix contain plenty of information including urban spatial structure, opportunities, activities and other socio-economic characteristics. The theories imply that O-D matrix have some strong connections to travel behavior in some ways. The first challenge is how to mine the information and extract some explainable elements. A limitation is that the empirical O-D matrix may only reflect the particular characteristics in that city and can not be applied to others. The second challenge is how to get a generalized interpretation, Once choosing the individual perspective, current theories and methods are still insufficient. For example, the physical transportation network is only a part of travel decisions. Social networks with a ‘hub-and-spoke structure’ play a prominent role in finding a job. Using social media data, some studies provide valuable insight but still have a gap to form new theories. An interdisciplinary perspective could provide a theoretical explanation for model selection. Existing mobility theories can play an anchor to identify the key variables’ property and confirm the additive and linear relation among the factors. References "],["struc.html", "Chapter 4 Model Structures 4.1 Multistage 4.2 Decision Tree 4.3 Multi-scales 4.4 Mixed Model 4.5 Non-linear models", " Chapter 4 Model Structures Based on related theories and studies, this section introduces several different analytical frameworks (Götschi et al. 2017). All three explanatory frameworks can find supportive evidences. They reflect the cognitive differences on this topic from various perspectives. 4.1 Multistage Figure 4.1: Multistage Structure Ben-Ariva and Atherton (1977) introduced a hierarchical framework of travel behavior. According to the length of time in travel decision, they divided the relevant factors into three levels. For example, people could change their travel mode choice for each day or each trip. Thus mode choice is a short-term decision Car ownership belongs medium-term decision since people usually don’t purchase or sell a car very often. Residential location choice is long-term decision because relocation is the most infrequent event than others. Under this framework, the decisions in longer term can affect the decisions in shorter term, but not vice versa. (Figure 4.1) For example, the distance to destination is decided by residential location choice and working location choice. And the distance is also a fundamental factor that influences travel mode choice behavior (Munshi 2016). In this way, both household car ownership, travel distance and travel attitudes are treated as intermediate variables connecting between built environment and mode choice in decision models. (Ding, Wang, et al. 2017; De Vos et al. 2021). A VMT models with stepwise framework is as follow. \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.1} \\mathrm{Y}=\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{L}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{L}+\\mathrm{X_{M}}{\\beta}_\\mathrm{M}+\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{S}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{S}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) are the coefficients with respect to long-term factors \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{L}\\), medium-term \\(\\mathrm{X_{M}}\\), and short-term covariates \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{S}\\). There could be two-way interaction effect between long-term and medium-term variables; three-way interaction effects among long-term, medium-term and short-term variables in the model (Equation (4.1)). This framework works well for commuting trips because people will not change work place very often. The mobility theories also agree with this pattern. “commuting trips are stable in time and account for the largest fraction of the total flows in a population.” (Van Acker and Witlox 2011). However, the number of non-commuting trips in the U.S. have been more than commuting trips in recent years (TODO source). For non-commuting travel purposes, such as shopping, leisure, or socializing, the destination choices are more flexible. The decision could be one-step. In consideration of all the benefit and cost, The traveler make a decision including the destination, mode and route at the same moment. It also could be multistep. Starting from a travel demand or purpose, the traveler decides to make a trip then choose the destination, mode, route, and departure time step-by-step from available alternatives based on benefit, cost, and habit. This process is progressive, iterative, and habitual in real life. Hence, the travel distance could be decided before or after mode or route choices. One structure only can capture one aspect of the process. The framework selection should suit the research question. 4.2 Decision Tree Figure 4.2: Decision Tree Structure The single-step decision frameworks often require some strong assumptions. For example, the principle of utility maximization applied in either mode choice or VMT models is supposed to explain all the observations, including no-trip or no-driving cases. Here these observation are treated as censored data with negative utilities. (That will leads to Tobit model for VMT.) In contrast, a Decision Tree structure allows to use a hierarchical structure to fit different observation respectively (Figure 4.2). The model will split into three equations (4.2) Starting from a travel demand or purpose, the traveler decides to make a trip or not at the first-level dichotomous node. A logit or probit model will fit all the data using a suitable model specification. Then the second layer with polychotomous nodes is about mode choice, which is respect to the multinomial models. At the bottom layer, a linear (or log-linear) model will only fit the data with positive driving distance (hurdle models; Ma, Yan, and Weng (2015); Reid Ewing et al. (2015)). It is remarkable that the covariates set could vary in different layer’s models. For example the lifecycle factor could strongly affect the travel frequency but not affect the driving distance significantly. Therefore, this structure is more flexible and is consistent with real decision process. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} E[\\mathbf{Y}_{\\{yes,no\\}}|\\mathbf{X_0}]=&amp;\\boldsymbol{\\mu_0}=g^{-1}(\\mathbf{X_0}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\\\ E[\\mathbf{Y}_{\\{car,bus,...\\}}|\\mathbf{X_1},\\mathbf{Y}_{\\{yes\\}}]=&amp;\\boldsymbol{\\mu_1}=g^{-1}(\\mathbf{X_1}\\boldsymbol{\\gamma})\\\\ \\mathbf{Z}_{\\{car\\}}=&amp;\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{2}\\boldsymbol{\\delta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{split} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{\\{yes,no\\}}\\) is a binary variable of making a trip or not. \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{\\{car,bus,...\\}}\\) is a categorical variable only including the cases of making a trip. \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{\\{car\\}}\\) is a continuous variable represent driving distance among the group of choosing driving. \\(\\mathbf{X}_{\\{0,1,2\\}}\\) means the three equations could have different model specifications and will estimate corresponding coefficients, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\). 4.3 Multi-scales Figure 4.3: Multi-scales Structure As discussed in previous section, the external factors affect individual’s travel behavior at multiple scales (Figure 4.3). It is necessary to distinguish the meso-scale and macro-scale variable. The external factors always affect a group of individuals. Therefore, the meso-scale factors like built environment still can be examined. But the social and nature environment will impact all the people living inside the cities and regions. Only when the data sources cover many cities or regions, these factors can be involved in the models.(Equation (4.3)) \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.3} \\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{U}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{U}+\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{N}{\\beta}_\\mathrm{N}+\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{H}{\\beta}_\\mathrm{H}+\\cdots+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{U}\\), \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{N}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{H}\\) are the covariates at the scales of urban, neighborhood, and household. And \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{U}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{N}\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{H}\\) are corresponding coefficients respectively. 4.4 Mixed Model Regression models usually assume the fixed effects of covariate on response. has to random effects In travel survey data, every observation are nested in some geographic units, such as tract, TAZ, or city (Ding, Mishra, et al. 2017). The geographic location often have some nature of artificial feature influencing travel but the factor is unknown or unobserved. When the data across many different regions, the model need to control the location effect to identify the crossed effect of built environment. For example, the hypothesis is whether density variable has a strong effects on travel in all place. In spatial analysis, autocorrelation is a common issue which means the observation values in a location will be affected by its neighbors. Mixed model can help to eliminate the neighborhood effects. \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.3} \\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{H}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{N}{\\gamma}+\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{U}{\\delta}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{U}\\), \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{N}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{H}\\) are the same as above. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is a vector of fixed effects. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\) are two vectors of random effects at neighborhood and urban scales. Assume that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\sim N(\\mathbf{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{N})\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\sim N(\\mathbf{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{U})\\). And also assume \\(Cov(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma},\\boldsymbol{\\delta})=Cov(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma},\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})=Cov(\\boldsymbol{\\delta},\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})=\\mathbf{0}\\). 4.5 Non-linear models As Clifton (2017) said, built environment-travel studies often assume the linearity holds for the density measures and the travel outcome of interest. In practice, the relationship of trip vesus built environment variables may be non-linear or follow a step function with lower and upper threshold. The shape of the curve is highly informative. Recently, scholars have an increasing interest in the non-parameter methods (Ding et al. 2021). The overall effects of density might be small. But the curve might have a steep rise or sheer drop in some intervals. The inflection points, called effective thresholds, are more attractive and instructional. For example, Using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990), Ewing’s study finds some potential points of encouraging shorter driving. His study recommended the suitable activity density (population and employment size/square mile) should be between 10000-25000 according to a center type (Figure ). Figure 4.4: Activity density v.s its smooth function ( Source: Ewing, R. 2021. Webinar: Transportation Benefits of Polycentric Urban Form) \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.4} \\mathrm{Y}=\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{C}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{C}+m(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{E})\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{E}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{equation}\\] In the model (Equation (4.4)), \\(m(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{E})\\) is a proper function of built environment covariates. The non-linear methods can better perform goodness-of-fit, but the generated new data are unique and harder to interpret. The non-linear methods can disclose more information from the data. The risk is that their results are more likely to reflect the features of the data itself and cannot be generalized to other cases. The results of linear and non-linear models cannot be compared because their underlying assumptions of distribution are different. The threshold studies in urban transportation field remain in the early stages. References "],["summary-opt..html", "Chapter 5 Summary (Opt.) 5.1 A Proposed Framework 5.2 Policy implications 5.3 Other thoughts", " Chapter 5 Summary (Opt.) It is impossible to design a replicable experiment controlling other factors to identify the effects of density. But it is possible to filter out the unsuitable or irreproducible models. 5.1 A Proposed Framework Related theories say that travel is determined by individual’s energy, distance, and city’s opportunity. A proposed framework is to re-categorize all potential factors by three aspects: budget, distance decay, and benefit/opportunity. And assign them into multiple spatial scales. Personal/household characteristics are travel budget that means the ability or willingness to pay for a trip. These factors are always point attribute rather than areal. A part of built environment factors, such as road connectivity, distance to transit, relate to distance decay and measure how easily people can move. From this perspective, a high local and nearby residential density may lead to greater resistance. Other built environment and urban form factors could represent the benefit or opportunity. The aggregated measurement only can caupure the variation between cities/regions. For disaggregated data, a complete assessment should evaluate all opportunities inside the daily travel range and their weights for each traveler. 5.2 Policy implications directionality and causality might not matter Ideally, the causal relationship between built environment and travel is preferred in studies. But as long as evidences support that these two have significant association, policy makers still can utilize this relation to achieve some social, economic, and environmental goals. Controlling the effects of self-selection make the research results more convincing. But from the policy perspective, if a city shows a more desirable travel pattern under a policy intervention, it doesn’t matter whether people change their travel behavior or people with different behavior relocated outside or inside this city. The nomological network among travel behavior, socioeconomic, and built environment factors is iterative and cumulative. Causal inference, such as disentangling residential self-selection, This study does not indicate . Policy cost and effect size matter There are different metrics, such as correlations, coefficients, or elasticities to measure the effect size. If it is possible, a quantified travel behavior change with respect to per unit of public investment is more attractive for policy maker and public. Generalisability and Reproducibility Scientist always want to find some generalized knowledge and hope it can be reproduced in all places. It requires a large amongt of evidences and stronger schemes. When a study can only explain and evaluate the built environment-travel association in a specific city or region, the results are still valuable for this city/region. the trip-based model (TBM) and activity-based model (ABM) are designed for forecasting the future scenarios based on the local data. These simulation methods are very elaborate and widely used. The Scales of Intervention The urban development policies have their spatial scales. For example, UGB would affect all the people in the metropolitan. A TOD project, and a neighborhood upzoning may change or not change people’s travel behavior who living or working inside the neighborhood. A case study In 2019, Oregon legislators passed the first law (HB2001) in the United States legalizing duplexes on city lots.14 ‘Missing Middle Housing’ (Figure ) claims that more middle-dense communities would make less reliance on cars.15 The goal of making American communities “car free” like some European cities has been widely discussed for many years.16 From “Compact City” (1970s), “New Urbanism” (1980s), to “Smart Growth” (1990s), urban planners and researchers agree that less automobile dependence has many benefits including fewer traffic accidents involving injury or fatality, less congestion, less greenhouse gas emission, more active trips and healthier lifestyle.17 The controversial part is the role of density. Does density strongly affect VMT - a primary variable representing the degree of automobile dependence? Independently or not? Does the effect exist everywhere or in a specific geographic range? 5.3 Other thoughts Aston et al. (2020) conduct a systematic analysis on study design of built environment-transit research. Their results show that study design has significant impacts on findings for the relationship between the built environment and transit use. Three methodological recommendations are made for future research: Where applicable, best practice approaches to specification should be adopted. Table 7 assembles best practice approaches according to theory. In the absence of best practice, researchers should use Sensitivity Testing to demonstrate a range of results generated when different methodological choices are made. Study design characteristics associated with significant differences in theoretical consistency or effect size should be further examined to determine whether there is a theoretically plausible reason for favoring certain alternatives. These include: Travel behavior data sources Population segments Transit modes Catchment buffer size and type Banister (2008) suggests that urban sustainable mobility should be the third principle in addition to derived demand and cost minimization. https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2001↩︎ https://www.sightline.org/2019/06/30/oregon-just-voted-to-legalize-duplexes-on-almost-every-city-lot/ https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019r1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/158465↩︎ https://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/carless-in-america/↩︎ https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/livability-factsheet-density.html↩︎ "],["data.html", "Chapter 6 Data", " Chapter 6 Data Data is the first source of variation. Due to the difficulty of gathering data, it is expected that the data in different studies come from other locations, periods, and groups. Only limited studies use countrywide or worldwide. Partial data may store only pieces of information. Of course, its outcome will only represent the local knowledge rather than the characteristics of the population. Merely adding a specific data source cannot support or against either side. Although people developed more new data-collection techniques and gathered more detailed data in the past years, eliminating the self-report bias is still a challenge. Hence, a nationwide random sampling dataset can mostly address this issue. Identifying the effects of the built environment on travel behaviors is harder than proving global warming. Scientists can get Antarctic ice core samples but cannot gather everyone’s daily travel records, in part because of personal privacy protections, and in part because of limited techniques for gathering these data. Surveys, traffic flow detection, or event data recorder (EDR) can only capture a small piece of the whole picture. Thus, to get a results without loss of generality, wide-range random-sampling data is a critical condition. 6.0.1 The daily travel data in the U.S. Nationwide Survey geographic levels is it statistically valid to use NHTS data In the 2009 NHTS, estimates are valid down to the state level. However, there are several things to note. First, several states and MPOs purchased add-on samples for their areas, so estimates in those areas may be (but are not necessarily) valid to smaller levels of geography. Second, standard errors (or margins or error in Table Designer) should generally be used, particularly when looking at estimates at geographies smaller than the national level. Third, previous surveys were sampled at even higher levels of geography, meaning samples were not valid down to the state level. For example, in 2001 estimates are valid down to the Census division level, while in 1995 and before, estimates are only valid at the Census region level. Add-on Partner 2001 NHTS, including five states and four MPOs 2009 NHTS interviews were sponsored by the 20 Add-on partners. With the more robust sample sizes provided in the Add-on areas, States and MPOs are able to perform more in-depth analyses and to drill down to smaller geographic units, such as cities or counties. 2017 NHTS thirteen States or MPOs https://www.bts.gov/table-3-2017-nhts-add-partners Descriptive Statistics Probability Distributions In the transportation field, there are some valuable studies to identify the distributions of trip variables. Based on some theoretical or empirical studies,18 scholars prove that trip generating frequency should not choose the linear regression models based on continuous functional forms. A zero-inflated negative binomial model is appropriate to solve the problems of over-dispersion and excess zero. This study implies that the diagnosis of variable distribution may be critical for regression modeling. For continuous variables, it seems like choosing log-normal distribution for trip distance/time is a convention. Pu (2011) choose log-normal as prior assumption because a report called Future Strategic Highway Research Program (F-SHRP)19 says “the log-normal distribution is the closest traditional statistical distribution that describes the distribution of travel times.” Actually, the new version, SHRP2 says “formal tests (e.g., a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) could be employed to evaluate the assumption and identify the sensitivity of the results to departures from this assumption.” (p. 130) Meanwhile, Lin et al. (2012) validates the daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) follows a gamma distribution in the context of PHEV energy analysis. Based on the multidate (7-200 days) data sets from four countries, Plötz, Jakobsson, and Sprei (2017) found Weibull distribution is an overall good two-parameter distribution for daily VKT; while the log-normal estimates are more conservative. The studies on trip distance are still not conclusive. But the attention of three distributions is similar to the survival analysis, which is also called time-to-event analysis (Kleinbaum and Klein 2012). This shows a potential relation with the Distance-Decay, or travel-time-budget theories (Marchetti 1994). Similar to that, Kölbl and Helbing (2003) show a canonical-like energy distribution for short trips by modes, which imply “a law of constant average energy consumption for the physical activity of daily travel.” Some studies are not limited in parameter methods. Simini et al. (2012) propose a parameter-free model that predicts patterns of commuting. Historical Trend This study chooses two informative and available data sources: the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration 2009) and the Smart Location Database (SLD) (Ramsey and Bell 2014) as the data source. NHTS20 is a nation-wide travel survey on travel and transportation patterns in the United States. NHTS includes some essential trip variables: number of trips, purpose, modes, VMT, etc. This is the first advantage over the local data source. NHTS is a well-designed survey. Some deliberate sampling methods make NHTS data representing the population-level travel characteristics. Although it is not as detailed as the GPS data, as large as the social media data, the second advantage of NHTS is it satisfies the fundamental requirement of statistic inference: random sampling. The new NHTS (2009 and 2017) “weights its person data based on control totals found in the American Community Survey (ACS).”21 This provides an opportunity of joining travel data to other demographic, employment, and built environment data. SLD also covers the entire US. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted SLD for measuring location efficiency and the built environment.22 SLD synthesized many data sources in around 201023 2425 2627 2829 30. SLD have more than 90 variables including ‘density of development, diversity of land use, street network design, and accessibility to destinations.’ 2009 NHTS and SLD have the same period and can join together by geographic locations. The initial data dimension is 150,145 observations by 192 variables. Hence, the joint datasets contain both trip and built environment information to fit VMT-density models. The last advantage is this dataset has almost reached the finest resolution for travel v.s built environment analysis. As found in literature, a parallel study requires the data includes multi-scale information. NHTS is conducted at four units: trip, person, vehicle, and household. While SLD is collected at the Census block group (CBG) level. The attributes can be synthesized at block, tract, county, and city scales by geographic identifiers (Table ??).31 At least two scales need to be aggregated: One is Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA).32 Another important scale is Urban Areas (including 486 Urbanized Areas and 3,087 Urban Clusters in 2010)33 It allows a cities-to-cities, metro-to-metro comparison with an uniform data source (Figure 6.1). Figure 6.1: The aggregate procedure Other data sources such as Call Detail Records (CDR), GPS, ICT, Point of Interest (POI), etc., can be combined with NHTS and SLD to enrich the information as long as one data contain the same index variable. For example, Point of Interest may represent the number of opportunities of place or utility of place. Although some data have high resolution and plenty of information, the geographic restriction and self-report bias should not be neglected. However, there are 57 5-D variables in SLD. The variables inside each D group are highly correlated. Based on previous research, this pilot study chooses only one variable from each D group.34 6.0.1.1 Trips, Vehicle, Personal, Household Aggregate data is more accessible and more convenient to combine with other data sources. For example, Reid Ewing et al. (2018) use the average per capita VMT of all urbanized areas across the U.S. from FHWA’s Highway Statistics. They joined the 2010 census tracts to FHWA’s 157 urbanized areas with populations of two hundred thousand or more. For disaggregate studies, collecting complete personal travel records and the built environment information is difficult. A common way is to get travel survey data from the local department of transportation and combine it with census data and GIS data. Many scholars start their relevant research from neighborhoods data, then extend the scope to the whole city or metropolitan area. Among the selected nine VMT-density studies in Reid Ewing and Cervero (2010), eight use single city/metro data35. Only one nationwide study using NPTS data (Schimek 1996) finds logarithm of household VMT has a non-significant elasticity (-0.07). Some studies begin to cover multi-region data (Zhang et al. 2012). Reid Ewing et al. (2015) accumulated a travel and built environmental dataset from 23 metropolitan regions in US.36 They find that all of the 11 D-variables have statistically significant effects on VMT. Since 1969, there is a person/household-level data on travel and transportation patterns in the United States, called the National Personal/Household Travel Survey (NPTS/NHTS). NHTS data include population density of census tract and gasoline-equivalent gallons consumed per year. Some studies use NHTS data to modeling the automotive CO\\(_2\\) emissions (Kim and Brownstone 2013; Perumal and Timmons 2017). But this dataset doesn’t contain enough built environment information and cannot support a full VMT-5Ds variable studies. Some studies add psychological factors such as role preferences, motivations, and expectations in choices to the models. Hong, Shen, and Zhang (2014) use eight attitudinal questions in the 2006 Household Activity Survey and improve the models’ \\(R^2\\) over 0.7. Sampling methods 6.0.2 Socio-Demographic Data 6.0.3 Built-Environment Data 6.0.4 Uints and Scales in the U.S. delineating criteria Tract scale and below: Similar Population Size with varying Area Size Boundary requirements: Census tract and BNA boundaries generally follow permanent, visible features, Demographic requirements: 4000 people (2500-8000)37 Block Group: 400 housing units (250-550)38 Block: 30,000 sq.ft.

Using the ratio of population to housing units for the nation in 2000 of 2.34 persons per unit, a density of 500 persons per square mile is almost exactly equivalent to 1 housing unit per 3 acres or 213.33 units per square mile. This was used as the minimum urban density threshold.” (Ottensmann, 2018) 6.0.5 New Data Source There are more and more transportation studies using GPS, ICT, trajectory, Point of Interest (POI) and social media data. Liu et al. (2017) use Point-of-Interest (POI) demand modeling to analyze human mobility patterns. Damiani et al. (2020) use trajectory summarization technique for the extraction of the locations of interest high-quality information. Using image recognition techniques, satellite imagery and Street View data provide unprecedented built environment information. The advantage of these new data sources is the high resolution and detailed information. Combining two types of data sources together has tremendous potential to answer VMT-built environment questions. However, the enormous amount of emerging data is also a huge challenge. The analysis methods of abstracting out generic information lags behind the data collection. How to eliminate the sample bias in new data sources is another unfinished work.

In general, modeling is a case-by-case work. Researchers may have their preferred model by weighing the sensitivity and robustness even given the same hypothesis and data. Hence, effective comparison or classification requires a few conditions: Of course, an effective comparison also should present the full results of model diagnosis and validation. In practice, a more certain modeling framework allows scholars to present more general conclusions and speak with a clear voice to the public and decision-makers. Checking the assumption of Independent Identically Distributed random variables (IID) 7.0.4.1 Checking Residuals The residual plots prove log-transform of VMT is reasonable because it has a highly right-skewed probability distribution. Only looking at the \\(R^2\\) and p-values cannot disclose this feature. This result suggests that residual diagnosis is an essential step for modeling validation. 7.0.4.2 Checking Residuals 7.0.4.3 Checking multicollinearity If the Variance Inflation Factor of a predictor variable is high (e.g. VIF=9), this means that the standard error for the coefficient of that predictor variable is 3 times larger than if that predictor had 0 correlation with the other predictors. Table ?? shows that the county-level model has serious multicollinearity issue. The double log transformation seems to enlarge the VIF values on D1a and D3a (Table ??,??). 7.0.4.4 Goodness of fit Two models with different specifications also have varied outcomes. The goodness-of-fit level is a premise. Although the coefficients of determination \\(R^2\\) are not the only criteria of a good model, it is often available in most published papers. The \\(R^2\\) in many disaggregate studies are around 0.3. A seriously underfitting model’s outputs could be biased and unstable. In these cases, the comparison must have strong constraints. By dint of some synthetic variables, the disaggregated model’s \\(R^2\\) can be over 0.5. But the risk is these techniques may describe the data themselves, and the results cannot be generalized. Meanwhile, the \\(R^2\\) in some aggregate studies can reach 0.8. It is worthy of a deeper investigation. 7.0.5 Interpretation 7.0.5.1 Standardized coefficients General case: It is very easy to go from the metric to the standardized coefficients.
