Many research have found that moderating the car use have positive social, economic and environmental impacts. The negative externalities of automobile include, but are not limited to, congestion, collision, unhealthy lifestyle, urban sprawl, social segmentation, pollution, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. Three dimensions can reflect the degree of car use, travel mode, driving frequency, and driving distance. Previous studies commonly choose two metrics for measuring them, the proportion of auto trips (or other modes) and Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).2 The proportion of mode is calculated by dividing the number of chosen mode over the total number of trips. The main travel modes, transit, bicycle, and walking are the alternatives to driving personal car. Given the same amount of travel demand, more active and transit modes means less car use. VMT is used to measure the travel distance made by a private vehicle. An integrated viewpoint is to treat the non-auto trips as zero-VMT. In this way, the probability distribution of VMT can comprehensively represents the travel behavior. The smallest unit of VMT is recorded by trip from a daily travel survey. Then these records can be aggregated to personal or household daily VMT (DVMT). A traveler’s or household’s DVMT can account for the degree of automobile dependency by combining the number of trips and driving distance during a day. Given the survey day is randomly selected, DVMT can reflect the typical travel pattern in general. Although, there are other approaches collect weekly, monthly, or longer VMT records by tracking car usage. The odometer records are more likely to represent the usage of vehicle rather than traveler’s behavior. It is not easy to acquire long-term VMT through survey-based method. The annual mileage and fuel efficiency information provided in some public data usually are estimated values using daily records and are not as accurate as DVMT. On a personal scale, VMT relates to the economic cost of travel by car, while another dimension, travel time measuring the time cost of vehicle travel. For society as a whole, the total VMT measures the usage of road network. Thus, it acts as a major interest within the field of transportation, especially in the research of travel demand and infrastructure capacity. And VMT highly correlated with the amount of fuel consumption, which is one of the main indicators of pollution and GHG emission. It is also one of the priority issues involving sustainable development and climate change. Previous research found that reducing VMT is instrumental in solving some urban problems and improving the qualities of urban life. It is natural that urban studies try to figure out the relationship between VMT and some urban built-environment factors. Then urban or regional policies could identify the best practices to contribute VMT reduction. or Vehicle Kilometers Traveled (VKT)↩︎ "],["travel-behavior-theories.html", "Chapter 2 Travel Behavior Theories 2.1 Mode Choices (Travel as a subject) 2.2 Human Mobility (Travel as an object)", " Chapter 2 Travel Behavior Theories Two different perspectives, individual and collective, can explain travel behavior. When people contextualizing travel as a personal choice or decision-making, the traveler as a subject make mode choices, driving or not. When travel behavior is understood as a social phenomenon, researcher observe and understand the trips as a whole. The two perspectives derived two schools of theory, mode choice and human mobility. In the school of mode choice, travel distance could be treat as an independent variable, a part of travel cost, or could be decided in the next step after mode choice , such as route choice. In the school of human mobility, driving distance grab more attentions. 2.1 Mode Choices (Travel as a subject) Are ‘decision’ and ‘choice’ the same when discussing travel modes? Literally, a ‘choice’ is one decision given all available options at the same time. While ‘decision’ is a broader concept. A decision could be a schedule with a combination of many choices, such as modes, destination, and activities. A decision related to travel behavior could even include bicycle or car purchase, and relocation. This section will start from the theories of mode choice, then extend to a broader discussion of decision processes. 2.1.1 Rational Choice Theory For prescriptive, analytical everyday decision-making, rationality is a basic assumption in reasoned behavior or rational choice theories (Edwards, 1954,Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944)(von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1947; Savage, 1954). This category is also called ‘Normative Decision Theory,’ which assume people a traveler is an ideal decision maker who are full rational. It requires three necessary steps including information collection, utility evaluation, and choice making. Expected Utility Theory (EUT) Traditional economics focus on the utility evaluation and come up with the Expected Utility Theory (EUT) which is also called Consumer Choice Theory. The rule of EUT is Random Utility Maximization (RUM) (Ben-Akiva &amp; Lerman, 1985; Daneil McFadden, 1973). This classical theory claims that customer always choose the one most appropriate by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of a range of alternatives, evaluating the benefits and costs of each possible outcome. Eventually travelers will select the optimal solution with the maximum ‘utility’ from the choice set. In real life, Rational Choice Theory can not accurately describe the actual human behavior. Individuals do not often collect and analyse all the relevant information. They are not ‘ideal’ and are not able to calculate the utility for all possible alternatives with perfect accuracy. In many cases, the travel decision is not regarded as the ‘best’ one to achieve travelers’ desired objective. Many other theories were developmed to fix these issues. 2.1.2 Prospect Theory Kahneman and Tversky (1979) introduced the Prospect Theory to study the impacts of biases. Prospect Theory is a descriptive theory with three main components: First, people are more sensitive to the sure things (e.g., the probability between 0.9 and 1.0, or between 0.0 and 0.1 ), while being indifferent to the middle range (e.g., from 0.45 to 0.55). Second, people care more about the change of overall proportion than the absolute values regardless of gains or losses. Third, people make choice based on a reference point, rather than the overall situation or worth. Economist also extend the theory of expected utility maximization to Behavioral Economics by address the influence of psychology on human behavior. ### Regret Theory Regret Theory introduces the notions of risk or uncertainty in decisions (Bell, 1982; Loomes and Sugden, 1982). Psychological studies found that individuals will not only try to maximize the utility but to minimize the anticipation of regret. The fear of regret could affect people’s rational behavior. For example, A high risk of congestion in peak hours could encourage a commuter to choose transit mode. Likewise, a good reputation for punctuality can give traveler confidence in the rail system. In addition to the traditional utility framework, a regret term is added to address the uncertainty resolution. The utility function on the best alternative outcome will be smaller after subtracting the regret term, which is an increasing, continuous and non-negative function. 2.1.3 Cognitive bias Another psychological factor, cognitive bias can result in judgement errors. For example, people treat potential gains and losses differently, that is called Loss Aversion. Loss Aversion suggests that the negative feeling about losses is greater than the positive response to gains(Kahneman et al. 1991). As a result, individual’s decisions may not be consistent with evidence and tend to pay additional costs to avoid losses. 2.1.4 Bounded Rational Behavior Bounded rationality focused on the limitation of self-control (March and Simon, 1958, Simon, 1955). In reality, individuals are behaving under many constraints including incomplete information, limited time, and cognitive capacity. The observed behaviors often are not optimal and are inconsistent with ‘pure’ rationality. Bounded rationality claims that, when people make decisions under constraints, heuristics and rules of thumb are more common than statistical inference. People are satisfied with a ‘good enough’ decision unless there is a definitively better alternative. The recently witnessed events would have stronger effects on an individual’s decision than others (Camerer and Loewenstein, 2004). 2.1.5 The choice process. McFadden (2001) hybrid choice model (HCM) and non-RUM decision protocols (Ben-Akiva et al., 2002) 2.1.6 Theory of Planned Behavior 2.2 Human Mobility (Travel as an object) Travel Distance in Physics and Geography The main laws of explaining travel behavior? There is a much longer history of human mobility studies in geography. The popularized ideas include Ravenstein (1885) ’s Law of Migration, Stouffer (1940) ’s Law of Intervening Opportunities, and Zipf (1946) ’s Zipf’s Law. Zipf’s Law says A city’s population size has a negative power relationship to its rank.3 The most influential theory in transportation modeling, Gravity Law (Newton 1848) asserts that the amount of traffic flow between two centers is proportional to the product of their mass and inverse to their distance. The mass could be population or opportunity. Using commuting data from six countries, Lenormand, Bassolas, and Ramasco (2016) found gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities law. An implication is that the gravity or opportunities at the destination drive people traveling, rather than origin. It may explain why the local density doesn’t strongly affect the trip distance in disaggregate studies. Actually, Zipf’s law and Gravity Law have a common essence of power law, or scaling pattern. The state-of-the-art studies of human mobility agree that travel behavior follows a power-law distribution at the population level (Barbosa et al. 2018). The power-law distribution also holds in many realms: urban size, population density, street blocks, building heights, etc. An example is Brockmann, Hufnagel, and Geisel (2006) use dollar bills to track travel habits and confirm this theory. It reflects the fact that both trip and built environment, as a type of geographic variables, follow some Paretian-like distribution. Apparently, it conflicts with Gaussian thinking, the foundation frame of linear models based on the location and scale parameters.4 Meanwhile, the log-normal distribution may be asymptotically equivalent to a special case of Zipf’s law, which could support the logarithm transform in current VMT-density models (Saichev, Malevergne, and Sornette 2010). Human behavior has two mobility roles: explorers and returners. It might be an inherent property of society. People are natural or nurtured likely to return to frequently visited locations or recently-visited locations. Instinct: Explore more territory. Keep together and division of labor. 2.2.1 Law of Migration 2.2.2 Law of Intervening Opportunities 2.2.3 Gravity Law and Distance-Decay 2.2.4 Time Geography (space-time aquarium/prism) 2.2.5 The Main Models individual level Random walk.Brownian motion and Levy flight population level Gravity models, Intervening opportunity models, the radiation models. the primary metrics for quantitatively describe travel behaviors Jump lengths Mean square displacement Radius of gyration Most frequented locations and motifs Origin-Destination matrices In geography, ‘distance decay’ means the interaction and the distance between two locations are inversely proportional. By Intervening Opportunities theory, this rule can be interpreted as the travel activity and the distance between origin and destination are inversely proportional too. Under the survival analysis framework, a trip is one event, trip distance represents ‘duration of time’ Since there are no censored data values, the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimator of the survivor function is the same with the Empirical Survival Function (esf). Figure ?? show the esf regular and logarithm scales for four units, four trip types, and three spatial scales.

After the meta-analysis of built environment and travel behavior by Reid Ewing and Cervero (2010), a recent update re-examines the post-2010 empirical literature and give a list. 3.1 Mechanisim (Several Perspectives) 3.1.1 Individual versus Environment A dichotomy may be defined as individual factors and environmental factors. Socio-Demographic and Economic Status, Attitude (e.g., vehicle ownership, attitudes, habits), interpersonal (e.g., interactions among households), built environment (e.g., commute distance, walkability, level of urbanization, etc.), and policy (e.g., restrictions on car use) levels. Major life events, travel behavior is highly habitual [25,26,27]. Some major life events, such as transitions to higher school, labor market, marriage, parenthood, retirement, and relocation, could provide windows of opportunity for travel behavior change. The results of a scoping review show that relocation prompts people to reflect on their travel behaviors (Larouche et al., 2020). During this windrow period, many factors at the personal, interpersonal, built environment, and policy levels could encourage people to choose active transportation (AT) and physical activity (PA). The reviewed research found that entry into the labor market often increases driving while retirement may have more walking or cycling for fewer time constraints. The effects of school transition may have different directions due to the environmental differences. Marriage is not significant because couples may live together before marriage. In a similar way, parents may have more car use several years after childbirth for the purposes of childcare, school, recreation, etc. Attitude (Psychological factors) Socioeconomic Environment Physical Environment and other factors 3.1.2 Morphology versus Functionality 3.1.3 Spatial Scales and Modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) Ecological bias caused by MAUP has been documented as two separate effects that usually occur simultaneously during the analysis of aggregated data.5 Scale effect:6 Zone Effect:7 Unit consistency8 “The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units.”9 Ye &amp; Rogerson.

Using the ratio of population to housing units for the nation in 2000 of 2.34 persons per unit, a density of 500 persons per square mile is almost exactly equivalent to 1 housing unit per 3 acres or 213.33 units per square mile. This was used as the minimum urban density threshold.” (Ottensmann, 2018) 3.1.3.1 Policy Intervention 3.1.3.1.1 Travel Demand Management (TDM) The levels of land use policy tools. “largely remain under a local government’s authority,” “This imbalanced institutional setting and fragmented government system” 3.1.3.1.2 Urban Policies (UBG,TOD, Zoning) the habit discontinuity hypothesis, major life events may provide windows of opportunity during which individuals may reconsider their travel behaviors and be more sensitive to behavior change interventions.21 ‘changes in built environment attributes may be particularly salient for behaviour change following relocation.’ 3.1.4 Built Environment “Attributes of the built environment influence travel by making travel to opportunities more or less convenient and attractive” (Domencich &amp; McFadden, 1975; Levinson, Marshall, &amp; Axhausen, 2017; Litman &amp; Steele, 2017). 3.1.4.1 5-Ds Variables Other Density (bulit-up, Employment, etc.) Another fundamental factor that influences travel mode choice behavior is the distance to destination, as would be expected (Munshi, 2016). Natural Environment By relationship To estimate the association of VMT response and urban density predictor, the general regression model is: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{Y}=\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{C}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{C}+\\mathrm{X_{D}}{\\beta}_\\mathrm{D}+\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{E}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{E}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\mathrm{Y}\\) are the variable of VMT. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) are the coefficients with respect to travelers’ characteristics \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{C}\\), density \\(\\mathrm{X_{D}}\\), and other environment covariates \\(\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{E}\\). \\(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\) are the error terms. It could develop different explanatory frameworks, which reflect the cognitive differences on this topic (Figure 3.1). 3.1.4.2 Personal/Household Scale (Micro level) Figure 3.1: Three conceptual frameworks The first framework posits that density or subdivided densities are the deterministic factors for relieving automobile dependence. In the model (Equation (3.1)), at least one covariate of density \\(\\mathrm{X_{D}}\\) should be associated with the trip variables \\(\\mathrm{Y}\\) significantly. The values of \\(\\beta_\\mathrm{D}\\) reflect the effects size of density on VMT. If density itself is ‘enough’ for the car-free goal, people should support HB2001. \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.1} \\mathrm{Y}=\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{C}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{C}+\\mathrm{X_{D1}}{\\beta}_\\mathrm{D1}+\\mathrm{X_{D2}}{\\beta}_\\mathrm{D2}+\\cdots+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{equation}\\] 3.1.4.3 Neighborhood/District Scale (Meso level) Community (Tract) 5 Ds Schwanen (2003): many urban form dimensions are tied to specific geographical scales All scale: Block and neighborhood levels: Regional: Density Urban design Local land use mix mono/polycentrism and centrality Regional jobs-housing balance The second framework assumes that density could only work when combined with other factors - land use mixture, good design, connected street network, and high quality of transit services. In the model (Equation (3.2)), \\(m(\\mathrm{X_{D}},\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{E})\\) is a proper function of density and environment covariates. Here density itself has no significant effect on VMT. If it is true, some terms of improving the design, transit, etc., should add into HB2001. \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.2} \\mathrm{Y}=\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{C}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{C}+m(\\mathrm{X_{D}},\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{E}){\\beta}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{equation}\\] Tradition of disaggregate analysis Other scholars believe that the internal difference of urban structure should not be neglected and the population and employment distribution are more important than region-level density. Using disaggregate data can disclose the neighborhood-level differences and eliminate aggregation bias. Using logarithms of VMTs per vehicle from National Personal Travel Survey (NPTS) data with 114 urban areas, Bento et al. (2005) fit the linear model with 19 variables. They found that, instead of population density, population centrality has a significant effect on VMT. The elasticity of annual VMT with respect to population centrality is 1.5.22 These studies also suggest that automobile dependence is a multi-dimensional issue. A proper model should add more socioeconomic and built environment variables. They started from adding three ‘Ds’ variables, density, diversity, and design (Cervero and Kockelman 1997), extended to five ‘Ds,’ adding destination accessibility and distance to transit (Reid Ewing and Cervero 2001). It even grows to seven with the addition of demand management and demographics. The 5Ds is one of the most influential ideas among the built environment–travel literature in the past decades. Using household-level or person-level data, these studies tried to disclose more complex relationships among the candidate factors by adding more relevant variables. The criticism from Handy (2018) says the 5Ds variables may not be independent. Although previous studies usually check multicollinearity issues, these variables still correlate with each other in some ways and may have strong interaction effects, which rarely be investigated. To get a general, comparable outcome, Reid Ewing and Cervero (2010) collect more than 200 related studies and try to summarize the elasticity values using meta-analysis. Elasticity measures the percentage change in response with respect to a 1 percent increase in a predictor. Thus, it is a dimensionless parameter. After screening, sixty-two studies were selected. But divided by modes (VMT, walking, and transit use), only nine studies were used to calculate the weighted-average elasticities of VMT with respect to population density. Of nine papers, six gave zero or insignificant elasticity, while three showed significant negative values (two are -0.04 and one is -0.12). The weighted-average elasticity of job density (sample size = 9) was zero. The largest elasticity of VMT belonged to Destination accessibility, -0.20 with respect to Job accessibility by auto (sample size = 5) and -0.22 with respect to Distance to downtown (sample size = 3). Due to the small sample size, the confidence intervals were not available. The authors call for more relevant studies to refine the results. Stevens (2017) also try to explain the different outcomes using a meta-regression method. Based on the results from 37 studies, they found the magnitude of effects is small and suggest that compacting development has a tiny influence on driving. In Reid Ewing and Cervero (2017) ‘s reply, they agreed with the values of elasticity but emphasize that Stevens’ results (-0.15 ~ -0.22) are not small actually. In a forthcoming study by Ewing and Cervero, an update elasticity of VMT per capita with respect to density is -0.15 (Reid Ewing et al. 2018). The third framework contends that density and other factors have different effective domains. The model will split into two equations (3.3), where \\(\\mathrm{Y_{I}}\\) is the individual/household-level VMT and \\(\\mathrm{Y_{A}}\\) is the VMT aggregated at the city/metro level. This framework supports some policies, such as Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). But the denser communities by HB2001 would not make VMT increasing. \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.3} \\begin{split} \\mathrm{Y_{I}}=\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{C}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{C}+\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{E}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{E}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\\\ \\mathrm{Y_{A}}=\\mathrm{X_{D}}{\\beta}_\\mathrm{D}+\\cdots+\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\end{split} \\end{equation}\\] 3.1.4.4 Urban/Metropolitan Scale (Macro level) Tradition of aggregate analysis The most influential aggregate studies start from Newman and Kenworthy. They published a series of studies to show a strong negative correlation between per capita fuel use and gross population density (GPD).23 Their sample covers from thirty-two to fifty-eight global cities (Newman and Kenworthy 1989a, 2015) and produced very convincing results. Their research points out the relationship rather than conducting regression analysis. Under their theory, the denser cities have less fuel consumption, which implies less automobile dependence. This is a succinct theory and is widely accepted by planners and policy makers. The criticisms include their ideological grounds, model specification, and sample selection.24 A trenchant criticism is that, for aggregated data, the population variable on both sides of the equation artificially creates a hyperbolic function (Equation (??)). One line of criticism is that the univariate or bivariate models may leave some critical factors out. While multivariate analysis methods can take account other socioeconomic factors such as fuel price, income, etc. In a recent debate (Fanis 2019), Newman clarified that “All our work shows that there are multiple causes of car dependence and multiple implications.” To address this issue, Coevering and Schwanen (2006) consider four sets of potential explanatory variables: ten of urban form, six of transport service, five of housing and development history, and thirteen of socio-economic situations. They fit some linear regression models (all the variables keep the initial magnitude without taking logarithm or other transformation) and all of their adjusted \\(R^2\\) are higher than 0.7. Their models also show that the cities with higher population density drive less. They found the land use characteristics of the inner area are more important than metropolitan-wide population density. Similarly, a recent city-level study (Gim 2021) fit multiple regression models based on the data from 65 global cities. The population density becomes not significant in this model. Their results show that fuel price, household size, and congestion level have strong effects on travel time. Using structural equation modeling, they also find the population density of the high-density built-up areas has a larger effect on travel than overall city density. Another line argues that the global comparisons are not valid, such as comparing Hong Kong and Houston. Reid Ewing et al. (2018) created a subset with only US Metropolitan areas from J. R. Kenworthy and Laube (1999) ‘s original data set. They fit the same model but get a much lower \\(R^2\\) (0.096) than Kenworthy and Laube’s (0.72). A similar work by Fanis (2019) shows the low \\(R^2\\) for US cities (0.1838) and European cities (0.2804) when deconstructing Newman and Kenworthy’s data by continent. Actually, any research question has its corresponding sampling design. Choosing a cutoff from the whole data often gets a different result. These criticisms are unfair for Kenworthy and Laube’s work. But it is true that the US cities have higher VMT and lower density than other countries’ cities. Recent evidence over a 20-year period from other cities and counties show that the status quo of the U.S. only represents a small window of the global trend(J. Kenworthy 2017). Even for U.S. cities, Reid Ewing et al. (2018) also found the inconsistent results in the aggregated and disaggregated studies. In their aggregate study, the elasticities of VMT with respect to population density is -0.164, a much higher value than disaggregate studies (-0.04 in the meta-analysis of Reid Ewing and Cervero (2010)). They suspect that this phenomenon is aggregation bias or ecological fallacy. They further explain that the two scales represent two different questions: The metropolitan-level density, which strongly affects the VMT, is not equivalent to the neighborhood density, which has much weaker effects on VMT. 3.1.4.5 Multi-scale Studies Ewing et al. (2020). Reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled, Encouraging Walk Trips, and Facilitating Efficient Trip Chains Through Polycentric Development Lee, S., &amp; Lee, B. (2020). Comparing the impacts of local land use and urban spatial structure on household VMT and GHG emissions. 3.1.5 The Role of Population Density Density is a critical built-environment factor in many theories, research, and policies. This factor can be represented by many approximate variables - built-up density, residential density, or employment density. Here the study chooses population density - how many people live in a square mile of land - and involves others if possible. For simplicity, the regression models including response VMT and predictor density are called VMT-density models. It changes along with the dynamic of land-use patterns. In U.S. history, urban transportation went through four general eras (Figure ): the walking-horsecar era (1800s - 1890s), the electric streetcar or transit era (1890s – 1920s), the automobile era (1930s – 1950s), and the freeway era (1950s - 2010s).25 The innovation of transportation is the deterministic driving force. Each revolution of transportation techniques reshaped the urban form and extended the people’s travel distances. By contrast, the relationships among VMT, density, and other physical, socioeconomic, and demographic factors were interactive and iterative. Which one caused which effect does not have a simple answer. “population-weighted density is equal to conventional density plus the variance of density across the subareas used for its calculation divided by the conventional density” (Ottensmann, 2018) use a geographically weighted regression (GWR) procedure to identify significant employment density peaks 3.1.5.1 Density and Urban Form Density, Pattern and Structure Urban Density Theories Zipf’ Law and rank scale Mono/Polycenticity 3.1.5.2 Density in 5Ds’ Framework theory is a significance-centered mixed factor sets 3.1.5.3 Advantages (Available, Measurable, accurate, Objective, and Informative) comparable 3.1.5.4 Measurments Overall Density and Propotional Weighted Density Moments for Urban Density The density’s mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, rank, destination density, or CBD density all can be the predictor candidates. References "],["frameworks.html", "Chapter 4 Frameworks", " Chapter 4 Frameworks Analytical and Explanatory Frameworks It is also impossible to design a replicable experiment controlling other factors to identify the effects of density. But it is possible to filter out the unsuitable or irreproducible models. 4.0.1 Travel related variables (a tree sturcture) 4.0.1.1 A structure by decision-making process A top-down decision tree starts from a travel demand or purpose. The first choice then reaches a dichotomous node, making a trip or not. The next level of internal nodes is a polychotomous choice, choosing a mode from walking, bicycle, transit, or driving. Each node can further extend to several branches with different routes and departure time, which determine the travel distance and time. A daily travel could include multiple trips and form a travel chain. The traveler may switch the sequence or adjust the routes to optimize the chain and minimize the travel costs. The daily total travel distance is the summation of every trip distances. The number of trips denotes as trip count. It exists but not so common that driving itself is the travel purpose, especially in daily life. 4.0.1.2 Another structure by time period According to the theoretical framework of hierarchical travel behavior introduced by Ben-Akiva and Atherton (1977), travel decision can be divided into three levels: long-term decisions (e.g. residential location choice) medium-term decision (car ownership) short-term decisions (e.g. travel mode choice). Another fundamental factor that influences travel mode choice behavior is the distance to destination, as would be expected (Munshi, 2016). 4.0.1.3 One-step or Multistep Progressive, iterative, and Habitual H1: One-step mechanism The traveler makes decision in consideration of all the benefit and cost, including the destination, travel mode, and route at the same moment. H2: Multistep mechanism The traveler decides to make a trip or not at the first-level node based on the demand, cost, and habitat. The traveler then choose a destination, mode, and route step-by-step from available alternatives. Which mechanism holds would answer below questions: Should the zero-VMT and positive-VMT observations be involved in regression analysis? If the answer is Yes, it implies the two-step (hurdle) models is proper. Should the no-trip and no-driving observations be confounded in VMT analysis? The reasons of no trip and no driving might be different. 4.0.1.4 When and How Population density affects travel distance. Given a driving trip, the distance is decided by the available destinations and their locations. After choosing the destination, the driving distance could be different among different routes, which affected by the road network. 4.0.2 Association and Causality (Self-selection Issues) Causal Inference and Self-selection Essentially, both VMT and density are dependent variable depending by the socioeconomic and techonological development. However, the urban form remains relatively more stable than individual’s travel behavior in each era. A family may be used to driving in Texas and turn to use the subway when they move to New York and vice versa. Given a period, VMT could be affected by density and other factors. It doesn’t make sense that VMT will change the density in the short term. Therefore, the relationship of VMT-density can hold in the context of the current stage of urban development and changing travel behaviors. Early research of automobile trips and urban density can go back sixty years (Mitchell and Rapkin 1954). Levinson and Wynn (1963) suggest that the people who lived in high-density neighborhoods make fewer automobile trips. This paradigm hasn’t changed until now. Due to the various data sources, related studies divide into two groups. One group uses aggregated trip and density variables at the city, county, or metropolitan level. At the same time, the other group uses trip data at the individual or household level. simultaneous equation model fake common cause back-door criterion The nomological network among travel behavior, socioeconomic, and built environment factors is iterative and cumulative. Causal inference, such as disentangling residential self-selection, requires further evidence and a stronger scheme. This study does not indicate directionality and causality. Detailed theoretical learning could better answer the question of variable properties and model structures. VMT may be determined by individual’s energy and city’s opportunity. Then, local density is an irrelevant factor. Reid Ewing et al. (2018) comment that the aggregate and disaggregate studies are asking the apples and oranges questions. This study will try to answer what apples and oranges are and what makes the difference. 4.0.3 Predictors, Mediators or Moderators (Ding et al., 2017) Based on the fact that travel distance is one of the most important factors influencing travel mode choice, therefore, similar to household car ownership, travel distance also mediates the connection between built environment and mode choice that should be treated as an intermediate variable. Similar framework relates to the study conducted by Van Acker and Witlox (2011). the influence of the built environment on travel mode choice considering the mediating effects of car ownership, travel distance and travel attitudes. (De Vos et al., 2021) 4.0.4 Effect Size (Correlations, Coefficients, Elasticities,) 4.0.5 Generalisability and Reproducibility References "],["discussion.html", "Chapter 5 Discussion 5.1 Research Design (Aston et al., 2020) 5.2 Trend and Dynamic 5.3 Policy implications (The Scales of Intervention)", " Chapter 5 Discussion 5.1 Research Design (Aston et al., 2020) The results show study design has significant impacts on findings for the relationship between the built environment and transit use. Three methodological recommendations are made for future research: Where applicable, best practice approaches to specification should be adopted. Table 7 assembles best practice approaches according to theory. In the absence of best practice, researchers should use Sensitivity Testing to demonstrate a range of results generated when different methodological choices are made. Study design characteristics associated with significant differences in theoretical consistency or effect size should be further examined to determine whether there is a theoretically plausible reason for favoring certain alternatives. These include: Travel behavior data sources Population segments Transit modes Catchment buffer size and type 5.2 Trend and Dynamic 5.2.0.1 From single layer to Multiple layers 5.2.0.2 From fixed effects to random effects 5.2.0.3 From linear to non-linear models and threshold studies 5.3 Policy implications (The Scales of Intervention) 5.3.0.1 UGB, 5.3.0.2 TOD, and 5.3.0.3 Upzoning In 2019, Oregon legislators passed the first law (HB2001) in the United States legalizing duplexes on city lots.26 ‘Missing Middle Housing’ (Figure ??) claims that more middle-dense communities would makeless reliance on cars.27 The goal of making American communities “car free” like some European cities has been widely discussed for many years.28 From “Compact City” (1970s), “New Urbanism” (1980s), to “Smart Growth” (1990s), urban planners and researchers agree that less automobile dependence has many benefits including fewer traffic accidents involving injury or fatality, less congestion, less greenhouse gas emission, more active trips and healthier lifestyle.29 The controversial part is the role of density. Does density strongly affect VMT - a primary variable representing the degree of automobile dependence? Independently or not? Does the effect exist everywhere or in a specific geographic range? Why “the locational context within an urban region is a more important factor of driving-related behavior than local urban form.” \\(H_1\\): Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) in geography Discloses the phenomenon but does not fully explain the reason. \\(H_2\\): Center Limit Theorem (CLT) in statistics Can explain the individual and local factors are confounded by aggregating. Can be proved by increasing the sample size. \\(H_3\\): Gravity or Opportunity theories in Human Mobility Can be proved by choosing different variable and model comparison. Should the spatial scale be in accordance with the mean (median) of driving distance? Is the local urban form an internal attribute or external factor? Should the trips be classified by purposes. All three explanatory frameworks can find supportive evidence. The significant effects of ‘population centrality’ or ’ high-density built-up areas’ support ‘the ’direct’ framework. The disaggregated studies support the ‘collaborated’ framework. The effects of density are not significant and have a small magnitude. The ‘compactness indices’ synthesized by density and other built-environment factors play a more important role over VMT. The aggregated studies show that density has a strong effect on VMT at the city scale, implying that the ‘respective’ framework is correct. Before further discussion, it is necessary to clarify the sources of variation in many studies. If one source is unintentional or mismatched, it should be controlled or corrected. If one source answers one type of question, then the differences are reasonable and should be preserved in categories. This study tries to find the boundaries or criteria for the categorized discussions. The second source of variation is from the use of different scales. The variables in different units, levels, and metrics may have various characteristics. For example, the personal v.s household’s records, block-level v.s city-level density, or daily v.s weekly trips are not identical. A systematic comparison should be conducted at various scales. A more general conclusion may hold if a significant factor appears with a similar effect size repeatedly at all scales. Otherwise, a separate discussion is appropriate. As an important type of technique, the trip-based model (TBM) and activity-based model (ABM) are very elaborate and widely used. These simulation methods are based on extrapolation and are designed for forecasting the future scenarios. They would not be included in this study. \\(\\beta \\bar X\\left(1-\\frac{\\bar Y}{n}\\right)\\) (Ewing and Cervero, 2010)↩︎ \\(\\lambda_i=\\exp[\\mathbf{x}_i&#39;\\boldsymbol{\\beta}]\\) (Greene, 2012, eq.18-21)↩︎ https://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/carless-in-america/↩︎ https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/livability-factsheet-density.html↩︎ "],["data.html", "Chapter 6 Data", " Chapter 6 Data Data is the first source of variation. Due to the difficulty of gathering data, it is expected that the data in different studies come from other locations, periods, and groups. Only limited studies use countrywide or worldwide. Partial data may store only pieces of information. Of course, its outcome will only represent the local knowledge rather than the characteristics of the population. Merely adding a specific data source cannot support or against either side. Although people developed more new data-collection techniques and gathered more detailed data in the past years, eliminating the self-report bias is still a challenge. Hence, a nationwide random sampling dataset can mostly address this issue. Identifying the effects of the built environment on travel behaviors is harder than proving global warming. Scientists can get Antarctic ice core samples but cannot gather everyone’s daily travel records, in part because of personal privacy protections, and in part because of limited techniques for gathering these data. Surveys, traffic flow detection, or event data recorder (EDR) can only capture a small piece of the whole picture. Thus, to get a results without loss of generality, wide-range random-sampling data is a critical condition. 6.0.1 The daily travel data in the U.S. Nationwide Survey geographic levels is it statistically valid to use NHTS data In the 2009 NHTS, estimates are valid down to the state level. However, there are several things to note. First, several states and MPOs purchased add-on samples for their areas, so estimates in those areas may be (but are not necessarily) valid to smaller levels of geography. Second, standard errors (or margins or error in Table Designer) should generally be used, particularly when looking at estimates at geographies smaller than the national level. Third, previous surveys were sampled at even higher levels of geography, meaning samples were not valid down to the state level. For example, in 2001 estimates are valid down to the Census division level, while in 1995 and before, estimates are only valid at the Census region level. Add-on Partner 2001 NHTS, including five states and four MPOs 2009 NHTS interviews were sponsored by the 20 Add-on partners. With the more robust sample sizes provided in the Add-on areas, States and MPOs are able to perform more in-depth analyses and to drill down to smaller geographic units, such as cities or counties. 2017 NHTS thirteen States or MPOs https://www.bts.gov/table-3-2017-nhts-add-partners Descriptive Statistics Probability Distributions In the transportation field, there are some valuable studies to identify the distributions of trip variables. Based on some theoretical or empirical studies,30 scholars prove that trip generating frequency should not choose the linear regression models based on continuous functional forms. A zero-inflated negative binomial model is appropriate to solve the problems of over-dispersion and excess zero. This study implies that the diagnosis of variable distribution may be critical for regression modeling. For continuous variables, it seems like choosing log-normal distribution for trip distance/time is a convention. Pu (2011) choose log-normal as prior assumption because a report called Future Strategic Highway Research Program (F-SHRP)31 says “the log-normal distribution is the closest traditional statistical distribution that describes the distribution of travel times.” Actually, the new version, SHRP2 says “formal tests (e.g., a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) could be employed to evaluate the assumption and identify the sensitivity of the results to departures from this assumption.” (p. 130) Meanwhile, Lin et al. (2012) validates the daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) follows a gamma distribution in the context of PHEV energy analysis. Based on the multidate (7-200 days) data sets from four countries, Plötz, Jakobsson, and Sprei (2017) found Weibull distribution is an overall good two-parameter distribution for daily VKT; while the log-normal estimates are more conservative. The studies on trip distance are still not conclusive. But the attention of three distributions is similar to the survival analysis, which is also called time-to-event analysis (Kleinbaum and Klein 2012). This shows a potential relation with the Distance-Decay, or travel-time-budget theories (Marchetti 1994). Similar to that, Kölbl and Helbing (2003) show a canonical-like energy distribution for short trips by modes, which imply “a law of constant average energy consumption for the physical activity of daily travel.” Some studies are not limited in parameter methods. Simini et al. (2012) propose a parameter-free model that predicts patterns of commuting. Historical Trend This study chooses two informative and available data sources: the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration 2009) and the Smart Location Database (SLD) (Ramsey and Bell 2014) as the data source. NHTS32 is a nation-wide travel survey on travel and transportation patterns in the United States. NHTS includes some essential trip variables: number of trips, purpose, modes, VMT, etc. This is the first advantage over the local data source. NHTS is a well-designed survey. Some deliberate sampling methods make NHTS data representing the population-level travel characteristics. Although it is not as detailed as the GPS data, as large as the social media data, the second advantage of NHTS is it satisfies the fundamental requirement of statistic inference: random sampling. The new NHTS (2009 and 2017) “weights its person data based on control totals found in the American Community Survey (ACS).”33 This provides an opportunity of joining travel data to other demographic, employment, and built environment data. SLD also covers the entire US. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted SLD for measuring location efficiency and the built environment.34 SLD synthesized many data sources in around 201035 3637 3839 4041 42. SLD have more than 90 variables including ‘density of development, diversity of land use, street network design, and accessibility to destinations.’ 2009 NHTS and SLD have the same period and can join together by geographic locations. The initial data dimension is 150,145 observations by 192 variables. Hence, the joint datasets contain both trip and built environment information to fit VMT-density models. The last advantage is this dataset has almost reached the finest resolution for travel v.s built environment analysis. As found in literature, a parallel study requires the data includes multi-scale information. NHTS is conducted at four units: trip, person, vehicle, and household. While SLD is collected at the Census block group (CBG) level. The attributes can be synthesized at block, tract, county, and city scales by geographic identifiers (Table ??).43 At least two scales need to be aggregated: One is Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA).44 Another important scale is Urban Areas (including 486 Urbanized Areas and 3,087 Urban Clusters in 2010)45 It allows a cities-to-cities, metro-to-metro comparison with an uniform data source (Figure 6.1). Figure 6.1: The aggregate procedure Other data sources such as Call Detail Records (CDR), GPS, ICT, Point of Interest (POI), etc., can be combined with NHTS and SLD to enrich the information as long as one data contain the same index variable. For example, Point of Interest may represent the number of opportunities of place or utility of place. Although some data have high resolution and plenty of information, the geographic restriction and self-report bias should not be neglected. However, there are 57 5-D variables in SLD. The variables inside each D group are highly correlated. Based on previous research, this pilot study chooses only one variable from each D group.46 6.0.1.1 Trips, Vehicle, Personal, Household Aggregate data is more accessible and more convenient to combine with other data sources. For example, Reid Ewing et al. (2018) use the average per capita VMT of all urbanized areas across the U.S. from FHWA’s Highway Statistics. They joined the 2010 census tracts to FHWA’s 157 urbanized areas with populations of two hundred thousand or more. For disaggregate studies, collecting complete personal travel records and the built environment information is difficult. A common way is to get travel survey data from the local department of transportation and combine it with census data and GIS data. Many scholars start their relevant research from neighborhoods data, then extend the scope to the whole city or metropolitan area. Among the selected nine VMT-density studies in Reid Ewing and Cervero (2010), eight use single city/metro data47. Only one nationwide study using NPTS data (Schimek 1996) finds logarithm of household VMT has a non-significant elasticity (-0.07). Some studies begin to cover multi-region data (Zhang et al. 2012). Reid Ewing et al. (2015) accumulated a travel and built environmental dataset from 23 metropolitan regions in US.48 They find that all of the 11 D-variables have statistically significant effects on VMT. Since 1969, there is a person/household-level data on travel and transportation patterns in the United States, called the National Personal/Household Travel Survey (NPTS/NHTS). NHTS data include population density of census tract and gasoline-equivalent gallons consumed per year. Some studies use NHTS data to modeling the automotive CO\\(_2\\) emissions (Kim and Brownstone 2013; Perumal and Timmons 2017). But this dataset doesn’t contain enough built environment information and cannot support a full VMT-5Ds variable studies. Some studies add psychological factors such as role preferences, motivations, and expectations in choices to the models. Hong, Shen, and Zhang (2014) use eight attitudinal questions in the 2006 Household Activity Survey and improve the models’ \\(R^2\\) over 0.7. Sampling methods 6.0.2 Socio-Demographic Data 6.0.3 Built-Environment Data 6.0.4 New Data Source There are more and more transportation studies using GPS, ICT, trajectory, Point of Interest (POI) and social media data. Liu et al. (2017) use Point-of-Interest (POI) demand modeling to analyze human mobility patterns. Damiani et al. (2020) use trajectory summarization technique for the extraction of the locations of interest high-quality information. Using image recognition techniques, satellite imagery and Street View data provide unprecedented built environment information. The advantage of these new data sources is the high resolution and detailed information. Combining two types of data sources together has tremendous potential to answer VMT-built environment questions. However, the enormous amount of emerging data is also a huge challenge. The analysis methods of abstracting out generic information lags behind the data collection. How to eliminate the sample bias in new data sources is another unfinished work. References "],["linear-models.html", "Chapter 7 Linear Models", " Chapter 7 Linear Models 7.0.1 Overview 7.0.2 Models Structures 7.0.2.1 Variable Transforamtion Among the above literature, some regression models take logarithm transforms on all variables, while others only transform one or a part. Even though they have various data sources, it is hard to believe they are all correct or equivalent. Some interdisciplinary knowledge could give some hints. 7.0.2.2 Fixed and Mixed Effects 7.0.2.3 Bayesian approaches (Opt.) 7.0.3 Models Specifications 7.0.3.1 Theoretical considerations 7.0.3.2 Subset Selection Empirical or methodological considerations 7.0.3.3 Shrinkage Methods Ridge Regression and Lasso 7.0.3.4 Dimention Reduction Methods Principal Components Regression (PCR) Partial Least Square (PLS) To address the multicollinearity and interactions issues, Clifton (2017) suggest to convert the various environmental characteristics to built environment indices. Some research try to use ‘compactness indices’ to replace the single density measurement.49 The primary method is principal components analysis (PCA), which synthesizes many variables to four dimensions: development density, land use mix, activity centering, and street connectivity. The advantage of this method is to increase the elasticity value significantly. A recent study shows that the elasticity of VMT with respect to a county compactness index is -0.78. Using a similar method (common factor analysis), Hong, Shen, and Zhang (2014) convert eight attitudinal questions in the 2006 Household Activity Survey to three factors: Ease, Convenience, and Pro-transit. They fit the model using two geographic scales: 1-km buffer and traffic analysis zone (TAZ). At the TAZ level, the nonresidential density and distance from CBD have significant effects on VMT. The disadvantage of this method is that the internal mechanisms of the indices are still not clear. 7.0.4 Diagnousis and Validation The third source, model selection, should also be controlled. In general, modeling is a case-by-case work. Researchers may have their preferred model by weighing the sensitivity and robustness even given the same hypothesis and data. Hence, effective comparison or classification requires a few conditions: Of course, an effective comparison also should present the full results of model diagnosis and validation. In practice, a more certain modeling framework allows scholars to present more general conclusions and speak with a clear voice to the public and decision-makers. Checking the assumption of Independent Identically Distributed random variables (IID) 7.0.4.1 Checking Residuals The residual plots prove log-transform of VMT is reasonable because it has a highly right-skewed probability distribution. Only looking at the \\(R^2\\) and p-values cannot disclose this feature. This result suggests that residual diagnosis is an essential step for modeling validation. 7.0.4.2 Checking Residuals 7.0.4.3 Checking multicollinearity If the Variance Inflation Factor of a predictor variable is high (e.g. VIF=9), this means that the standard error for the coefficient of that predictor variable is 3 times larger than if that predictor had 0 correlation with the other predictors. Table ?? shows that the county-level model has serious multicollinearity issue. The double log transformation seems to enlarge the VIF values on D1a and D3a (Table ??,??). 7.0.4.4 Goodness of fit Two models with different specifications also have varied outcomes. The goodness-of-fit level is a premise. Although the coefficients of determination \\(R^2\\) are not the only criteria of a good model, it is often available in most published papers. The \\(R^2\\) in many disaggregate studies are around 0.3. A seriously underfitting model’s outputs could be biased and unstable. In these cases, the comparison must have strong constraints. By dint of some synthetic variables, the disaggregated model’s \\(R^2\\) can be over 0.5. But the risk is these techniques may describe the data themselves, and the results cannot be generalized. Meanwhile, the \\(R^2\\) in some aggregate studies can reach 0.8. It is worthy of a deeper investigation. 7.0.5 Interpretation 7.0.5.1 Standardized coefficients General case: It is very easy to go from the metric to the standardized coefficients.

The two studies capture higher elasticities of per capita VMT with respect to density (-0.38 and -0.238) (Cervero and Murakami 2010; Reid Ewing, Hamidi, et al. 2014). As far as methods, standardization, orthogonalization before fitting the model might be helpful. References "],["non-linear-models.html", "Chapter 8 Non-Linear Models", " Chapter 8 Non-Linear Models 8.0.1 Overview As Clifton (2017) said, relevant studies often assume the linearity holds for the density measures and the travel outcome of interest. In practice, the relationship of trip v.s. built environment variables may be non-linear or follow a step function with lower and upper threshold. The shape of the curve is highly informative. Recently, scholars have an increasing interest in the non-parameter methods (Ding et al. 2021). The overall effects of density might be small. But the curve might have a steep rise or sheer drop in some intervals. The inflection points, called effective thresholds, are more attractive and instructional. For example, Using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990), Ewing’s study finds some potential points of encouraging shorter driving. His study recommended the suitable activity density (population and employment size/square mile) should be between 10000-25000 according to a center type (Figure ). Activity density v.s its smooth function ( Source: Ewing, R. 2021. Webinar: Transportation Benefits of Polycentric Urban Form). The synthesized methods can better perform goodness-of-fit, but the generated new data are unique and harder to interpret. The non-linear methods can disclose more information from the data. The risk is that their results are more likely to reflect the features of the data itself and cannot be generalized to other cases. The results of linear and non-linear models cannot be compared because their underlying assumptions of distribution are different. The urban studies field usually doesn’t discuss the distribution of the key variables themselves. An interdisciplinary perspective could provide a theoretical explanation for model selection. Existing mobility theories can play an anchor to identify the key variables’ property and confirm the additive and linear relation between VMT and density. 8.0.2 Main Approaches 8.0.2.1 Polynomial Regression 8.0.2.2 Step Funtions 8.0.2.3 Basis Funtions 8.0.2.4 Splines 8.0.2.5 Local Regression 8.0.2.6 Generalized Additive Models 8.0.3 Summary Expected finding, implications, and limitations References "],["meta-analysis.html", "Chapter 9 Meta-Analysis", " Chapter 9 Meta-Analysis 9.0.1 Overview Scholars debate the elasticity is “large” or “small.” Defining proper criteria of ‘Clinical Significance’55 might be more beneficial than statistical significance in practice. 9.0.1.1 Effect Sizes 9.0.1.2 Pooling Effect Sizes 9.0.1.3 Between-Study Heterogeneity 9.0.1.4 Forest Plots 9.0.1.5 Subgroup Analyses 9.0.1.6 Meta-Regression 9.0.1.7 Publication Bias 9.0.2 Advanced Methods 9.0.2.1 Multilevel Meta-Analysis 9.0.2.2 Structural Equation Modeling Meta-Analysis 9.0.2.3 Network Meta-Analysis 9.0.2.4 Bayesian Meta-Analysis 9.0.3 Summary the practical importance of a treatment effect in medicine and psychology↩︎ "],["appendix-a.html", "A Appendix A", " A Appendix A "],["appendix-b.html", "B Appendix B", " B Appendix B "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
