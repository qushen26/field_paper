## Background

In the {==past decades==}{>>decades?<<}, efforts have been made to reduce automobile dependency, as reducing  car use have found to have positive social, economic and environmental impacts. Negative externalities of automobile use include congestion, collision, unhealthy lifestyle, urban sprawl, social segmentation, pollution, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.

Before policy makers in urban and transportation planning can devise policies to reduce auto use, researchers need to identify factors correlated with and, ideally, influencing travel behavior. This is especially challenging because of a number of reasons:

1. Most of the data in the field are observational data;
1. There are numerous measures of outcome and independent variables of interest;
1. These data are for different units in space and analytic method need to take account of spatial correlation.


## Analytical Framework

@handyCriticalAssessmentLiterature2005 gives a critical assessment for travel-urban form literature.

~~Under this framework, regression analysis currently is still the dominate method for explaining the relationship between urban form and travel.
A large mount of studies use regression models to identify the influencing factors and evaluate the effect size.~~ <!-- not directly related to FRAMEWORK & theory-->


There are numerous travel behavioral outcomes of interest, including
- Vehicle or personal miles traveled (VMT or PMT) ^[or Vehicle Kilometers Traveled (VKT)]
- Mode choice and mode share/split
- Trip frequency and count


## Content Organization

<!-- \@ref(struc) -->
The remaining of the paper is organized as follow:

Chapter 2 [Urban Form](#form) identifies measures of urban form used in the literature and systematically reviews factors significantly influencing travel behavior reported in the literature.

Aggregate and disaggregated data at vary [Spatial Scales](#scale) can sway the meaning of influencing factors. Units and spatial scales should be careful chosen to make sure the results matching the initial research questions.

Chapter 3, [the theories of travel behavior](#travel) can be divided into [Traveler Choice][Traveler Choice] and [Human Mobility][Human Mobility] by looking travel as object or subject.
These theories and practice can enrich the understanding of travel variable as response of model.

[Chapter 4][Model Structures] presents several common model structures in existing literature of this field. It demonstrate the different perspectives of the relationship between urban form and travel. Some new trends and methods are also included in this chapter.
