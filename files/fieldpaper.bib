	abstract = {Automobile dependence, expressed through comparative levels of car ownership and use and transit service and use, varies widely and systematically across a large sample of international cities. US cities exhibit the most extreme dependence on the automobile, followed by Australian and Canadian cities, with European and Asian cities having very much more transit-oriented cities with greater levels of walking and cycling. These patterns are not strongly related to differences in wealth between cities, but do vary in a clear and systematic way with land use patterns. The total fixed and variable cost of cars per kilometre is also significantly related to the degree of automobile dependence in cities, though not as strongly as land use. The data suggest that the most auto-dependent cities are less wealthy than some other more transit-oriented cities. They have the worst operating cost recovery in transit, have far higher road construction and maintenance costs, spend the highest proportion of their wealth on passenger transportation but have roughly similar journey-to-work trip times and much longer trip lengths. These patterns suggest some important policy implications which stress the need to strategically reshape urban land use, to emphasise investment in non-auto infrastructure and to ensure that any physical planning strategies aimed at reducing automobile dependence work in concert with economic policies directed at increasing the real cost of both car ownership and car use.},

In other words, these cultural and economic changes are happening in walking and transit city fabrics, but not in automobile city fabrics.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses seven metropolitan regions that are all experiencing rapid motorisation and are perhaps appearing to capitulate to the automobile. Through 20 years of changes, evidenced in systematic data from the mid-1990s, a different perspective is found. None of the urban regions appear near to or even capable of becoming automobile cities. Physical limits are already being reached that make higher levels of private motorised mobility very problematic if transport systems are to remain functional and the cities livable. These limits appear already to be reversing the decline in non-motorised modes and creating an upturn in transit systems, especially urban rail. That these cities have been able to either hold their own, or somewhat increase their share of total motorised mobility by transit over a 20-year period, is some indication that they are {\textquoteleft}hitting mobility walls{\textquoteright} much sooner in the motorisation path than cities in North America and Australia, which grew up with and were designed around the spatial needs of cars. Like many cities in the developed world that have shown a decoupling of car use and total passenger mobility from GDP growth from 1995 to 2005, there is now evidence that this is happening in less wealthy cities. This is important because it assists global and local goals for reduced CO2 from passenger transport, while allowing for economic progress. Such evidence suggests that automobile dependence is not an irresistible force in emerging economies.},

To investigate the seriousness of these concerns, the data collected by Kenworthy and colleagues for European, Canadian and US cities in 1990 have been augmented with information on housing, urban development history and the sociodemographic situation. Regression models are described in which the role of urban form is investigated while account is taken of other relevant factors. The empirical analysis suggests that the space-time context of cities should be taken into account in aggregate-level comparisons of the relations between urban form and transport. Policy recommendations based on the original data may be reconsidered and tailored to the space-time context and population characteristics of cities.},

They established a policy objective of minimizing gasoline consumption and recommended a twin strategy of "reurbanization" and investment in urban rail transit. An analysis of the wisdom of fuel use minimization, the validity of global comparisons, the impact of urban structure on travel, the potential for rail transit and modal choice, and the land impact of transit development suggest that NK's analysis is faulty and that their policy and planning prescriptions are inappropriate and unfeasible.},

Using fine-scale home-to-work commuting data for Wallonia (Belgium), this paper re-evaluates Breheny{\textquoteright}s (1995) assertion that urban structure should hold the characteristics of major cities if substantial energy savings are to be achieved. A local scale approach highlights efficient settlements in terms of transport energy consumption not only within major towns, but also within remote rural areas. Furthermore, results suggest that influencing the urban form following local energy efficient examples rather than regional ones could also yield significant gains, without an extreme policy stance of re-urbanisation in major cities.},

	abstract = {Using data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, we quantify the effects of settlement patterns on individual driving habits and the resulting automotive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We employ CO2 emissions to capture this impact accurately, as it reflects both vehicle miles traveled and any spatial differences in vehicle fuel efficiency choices. While previous studies have compared automotive travel in urban and suburban areas, our approach characterizes emissions across the entire US rural{\textendash}urban gradient, focusing on the effects of population density. Rather than using categorical measures of contextual density (city, suburb, town, etc.), we use a geographical information system to calculate continuous measures of contextual density, that is, density at different proximities to households. These measures of contextual density allow us to model travel effects induced by the gravitational pull of the population densities of urban cores. Further, our methodological approach frames location choice as an endogenous treatment effect; that is, residential locations are not randomly assigned across our sample and significantly alter driving behavior. We find that individuals living in urban cores generate the lowest per capita automotive CO2 emissions, due to close proximities of population concentrations. Rather than attracting individuals who would likely have low CO2 emissions anyway, urban location apparently mitigates the emissions of people who would otherwise tend to have high automotive CO2 emissions. We find larger elasticities with respect to density than previous studies and also find that the attractive forces of population densities affect driving patterns at distances up to sixty-one kilometers outside of urban areas.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, traffic assignment models, both for within-day static and dynamic demand, have been formulated following an equilibrium approach in which a state ensuring internal consistency between demand (flows) and costs is sought. However, equilibrium analysis is significant under some assumptions on its {\textquotedblleft}representativeness{\textquotedblright} (coincidence or closeness with the actual attractor of the system) and analytical properties, such as existence, uniqueness, and stability. Moreover, transients due to modifications of demand and/or supply cannot be simulated through equilibrium models, nor can a statistical description of the state of the system, i.e. means, modes, moments and, more generally, frequency distributions of flows over time be obtained. In this paper, interperiodic (day-to-day) dynamic modeling of transportation networks is addressed following two different approaches, namely deterministic and stochastic processes. In both cases several theoretical results are shown by making use of a formal framework covering most models discussed in the literature as well as some possible extensions. Most of the results reported can be extended to cover within-day dynamic models but these models are not explicitly dealt with. Within the framework of deterministic processes the relevance of day-to-day dynamic models for demand/supply interaction in comparison with the traditional user equilibrium approach is discussed, and conditions for coincidence of fixed-point attractors and equilibrium states are stated. Conditions for existence and uniqueness of fixed-point attractors are proposed, generalizing and extending those presented in the literature for user equilibrium. Conditions for stability of both fixed-points and equilibrium states were formulated by making use of results from non-linear dynamic system theory. Moreover, it is possible to devise a new family of {\textquotedblleft}dynamic{\textquotedblright} algorithms which simulate the system convergence to a fixed-point in order to obtain an equivalent equilibrium state, as opposed to conventional {\textquotedblleft}optimisation{\textquotedblright} algorithms. In this case the fixed-point stability analysis can be viewed as a convergence analysis for the algorithms specified this way. Conditions for stochastic process regularity are proposed ensuring, among other things, existence and uniqueness of a stationary probability distribution of system states. These conditions generalize and extend results presented in the literature to a wider class of possible dynamic models. Relationships between a deterministic process, together with corresponding fixed-points or equilibrium states, and stochastic probability distribution are also briefly addressed. Finally, some numerical examples confirming theoretical results are reported for a small test network.},

	abstract = {The transportation phenomena, as a manifestation of the complex human, social, economic, and political interactions, are filled with uncertainties. In order for the analysis of transportation to be scientifically credible, uncertainty must be accounted for properly. Traditionally, probability theory has been used as the only paradigm for dealing with uncertainty without much thought being given to its limits of application. In recent years, a systematized framework of uncertainty theory that handles different types of uncertainty has emerged. In this framework, possibility theory offers a useful way of handling the uncertain situations that often arise in transportation analysis, particularly when incomplete data and perception are involved. This paper describes possibility theory for its mathematical structure, and discusses the reasons why its use is justified for analysis of certain transportation problems. It is shown that the use of a particular theoretical framework depends on the type of information available and the nature of the predicate of the proposition. Probability theory is justified when the propensity of occurrence of well-defined events is the issue. Possibility theory, on the other hand, is justified when the information is partially perceived and evidence points to the nested sets. The dual measures of possibility theory, possibility and necessity, evaluate the truth, optimistically and conservatively. This paper advocates the use of a proper analysis framework that is consistent with the type of information. Such an attitude not only enhances the scientific credibility of the field but also allows the analyst to express how much is known and how much is not known honestly.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of opportunistic and dedicated sensors is transforming a once data-starved transport field into one of the most data-rich. While link-level travel time information can be derived or inferred from this data, methods for estimation of trip travel times between an origin and a destination pair are still evolving and limited, especially in the context of probability distribution estimation. This paper proposes a generalized Markov chain approach for estimating the probability distribution of trip travel times from link travel time distributions and takes into consideration correlations in time and space. The proposed approach consists of three major components, namely state definition, transition probabilities estimation and probability distribution estimation. A heuristic clustering method, based on Gaussian mixture models, has been developed to cluster link travel time observations with regard to their homogeneity and underlying traffic conditions. A transition probability estimation model is developed as a function of link characteristics and trip conditions using a logit model. By applying a Markov chain procedure, the probability distribution of trip travel times is estimated as the combination of Markov path travel time distributions weighted by their corresponding occurrence probabilities. The link travel time distribution is conditioned on the traffic conditions of the current link that can be estimated from historical observations. A moment generating function based algorithm is used to approximate the Markov path travel time distribution as the sum of correlated link travel time distributions conditional on traffic conditions. The proposed approach is applied in a transit case study using automatic vehicle location data. The results indicate that the method is effective and efficient, especially when correlations and multimodal distributions exist.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on exploiting Call Detail Records (CDR) data in order to detect the demand distribution among different zones within the day, together with information about the type of activity that characterises each zone. Traffic zones are first identified and shaped through a k-means clustering analysis. Then, the traffic between different clusters is analysed with the aim to identify the type of zone by evaluating the traffic calls density for each time period. To evaluate the propagation of the demand among the different zones, Markov Chains theory is used in order to evaluate the transition matrix among different time steps. The developed model enables one to predict CDR variations in time and space and, hence, being a proxy for the trip distribution. Results point out how these matrices are similar for consecutive time intervals; therefore, it is possible to aggregate them in an hourly transition matrix, losing a small amount of information over the structure of the demand. This also shows that trip distribution varies relatively slowly in time and is spatially consistent along the days.},

It should be checked if there are overdispersion and excess zero responses in count data to forecast the generation of trips. The forecasted values should also be non-negative ones. The study applies to nonhome based trips at household level to perform efficient analysis on count data. The Poisson model with an assumption of equidispersion has frequently been used to analyze count data. However, if the variance of data is greater than the mean, the Poisson model tends to underestimate errors, resulting in problem in reliability. Excess zeros in data result in heterogeneity leading to biased coefficient estimates for the models. The negative binomial model and the modified count data models are established to consider overdispersion and heterogeneity to improve the reliability. The optimal model is chosen through Vuong test. Model reliability is also checked by likelihood test and accuracy of estimated value of model by Theil inequality coefficient. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to know the change of nonhome based trips depending on the change in socio-economic characteristics.},

	abstract = {Travel time reliability is measured in various ways. Measures used in the transportation engineering field include the 90th or 95th percentile travel time, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, percent of variation, buffer index, planning time index, travel time index, skew statistic, misery index, frequency of congestion, and on-time arrival. Correlations and inconsistencies between these measures were observed on a case-by-case basis in past studies, without a full explanation or examination of the fundamental causes of such differing relationships. This paper analytically examines a number of reliability measures and explores their mathematical relationships and interdependencies. With the assumption of lognormal distributed travel times and the use of percent point function, a subset of reliability measures is expressed in relation to the shape parameter or the scale parameter of the lognormal distribution or to both. This process enables a clear understanding of the quantitative relationships and variation tendencies of different measures. Contrary to some previous studies and recommendations, this paper finds that the coefficient of variation, instead of the standard deviation, is a good proxy for several other reliability measures. The use of the average-based buffer index or average-based failure rate is not always appropriate, especially when travel time distributions are heavily skewed, in which case the median-based buffer index or failure rate is recommended.},

	abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the utility of PEVs, as well as reduction of emissions is highly dependent on daily vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT). Further, the daily VKT by individual passenger cars vary strongly between days. A common method to analyse individual daily VKT is to fit distribution functions and to further analyse these fits. However, several distributions for individual daily VKT have been discussed in the literature without conclusive decision on the best distribution. Here we analyse three two-parameter distribution functions for the variation in daily VKT with four sets of travel data covering a total of 190,000 driving days and 9.5 million VKT. Specifically, we look at overall performance of the distributions on the data using four goodness of fit measures, as well as the consequence of choosing one distribution over the others for two common PEV applications: the days requiring adaptation for battery electric vehicles and the utility factor for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. We find the Weibull distribution to fit most vehicles well but not all and at the same time yielding good predictions for PEV related attributes. Furthermore, the choice of distribution impacts PEV usage factors. Here, the Weibull distribution yields reliable estimates for electric vehicle applications whereas the log-normal distribution yields more conservative estimates for PEV usage factors. Our results help to guide the choice of distribution for a specific research question utilising driving data and provide a methodological advancement in the application of distribution functions to longitudinal driving data.},

Small prediction errors caused by the gamma assumption were found in PHEV fuel use, electricity use, and energy cost. Validating the reliability of the gamma distribution paves the way for its application in energy use analysis of PHEVs in the real world. The gamma distribution can be easily specified with few pieces of driver information and is relatively easy for mathematical manipulation. Validation with real world travel data enables confident use of the gamma distribution in a variety of applications, such as the development of vehicle consumer choice models, the quantification of range anxiety for battery electric vehicles, the investigation of the role of charging infrastructure, and the construction of online calculators that provide personal estimates of PHEV energy use.},

However, in fact, variable selection often complicates analysis as it invalidates common tools of statistical inference such as P-values and confidence intervals. This is a particular problem in transplantation research where sample sizes are often only small to moderate. Furthermore, variable selection requires computer-intensive stability investigations and a particularly cautious interpretation of results. We discuss how five common misconceptions often lead to inappropriate application of variable selection.

	abstract = {Trip distribution laws are basic for the travel demand characterization needed in transport and urban planning. Several approaches have been considered in the last years. One of them is the so-called gravity law, in which the number of trips is assumed to be related to the population at origin and destination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical expression of this law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another popular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening opportunities which argues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only the role of a surrogate for the number of intervening opportunities between them. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two approaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them against empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different countries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening opportunities laws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the probability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called trip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the commuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We show that the gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities laws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network and to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting commuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that the different approaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for calibration since their only parameter depends only on the scale of the geographic unit.},

This corresponds to a canonical-like energy distribution with exceptions for short trips, which can be theoretically explained. Combined, this points to a law of constant average energy consumption for the physical activity of daily travel.

While some efforts have been made for the demand analysis of some specific POI categories, such as restaurants, it lacks systematic means to support POI demand modeling. To this end, in this paper, we develop a systematic POI demand modeling framework, named Region POI Demand Identification (RPDI), to model POI demands by exploiting the daily needs of people identified from their large-scale mobility data. Specifically, we first partition the urban space into spatially differentiated neighborhood regions formed by many small local communities. Then, the daily activity patterns of people traveling in the city will be extracted from human mobility data. Since the trip activities, even aggregated, are sparse and insufficient to directly identify the POI demands, especially for underdeveloped regions, we develop a latent factor model that integrates human mobility data, POI profiles, and demographic data to robustly model the POI demand of urban regions in a holistic way. In this model, POI preferences and supplies are used together with demographic features to estimate the POI demands simultaneously for all the urban regions interconnected in the city. Moreover, we also design efficient algorithms to optimize the latent model for large-scale data. Finally, experimental results on real-world data in New York City (NYC) show that our method is effective for identifying POI demands for different regions.},

Despite the considerable efforts made by a few scientific communities and the relevant results obtained so far, there are still many issues only partially solved that ask for general and quantitative methodologies to be addressed. A prominent aspect of scientific and practical relevance is how to characterize the mobility behavior of individuals. In this article, we look at the problem from a location-centric perspective: We investigate methods to extract, classify, and quantify the symbolic locations specified in telco trajectories and use such measures to feature user mobility. A major contribution is a novel trajectory summarization technique for the extraction of the locations of interest, i.e., attractive, from symbolic trajectories. The method is built on a density-based trajectory segmentation technique tailored to telco data, which is proven to be robust against noise. To inspect the nature of those locations, we combine the two dimensions of location attractiveness and frequency into a novel location taxonomy, which allows for a more accurate classification of the visited places. Another major contribution is the selection of suitable entropy-based metrics for the characterization of single trajectories, based on the diversity of the locations of interest. All these components are integrated in a framework utilized for the analysis of 100,000+ telco trajectories. The experiments show how the framework manages to dramatically reduce data complexity, provide high-quality information on the mobility behavior of people, and finally succeed in grasping the nature of the locations visited by individuals.},

In particular the fine granularity of the location data, with GPS accuracy down to 10 meters, and the worldwide scale of Foursquare adoption are unprecedented. In this paper we study urban mobility patterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing a large set of Foursquare users. Surprisingly, while there are variations in human movement in different cities, our analysis shows that those are predominantly due to different distributions of places across different urban environments. Moreover, a universal law for human mobility is identified, which isolates as a key component the rank-distance, factoring in the number of places between origin and destination, rather than pure physical distance, as considered in some previous works. Building on our findings, we also show how a rank-based movement model accurately captures real human movements in different cities.},

Here we show, on the basis of a data set describing the trajectories of 780,000 private vehicles in Italy, that the L{\'e}vy flight model cannot explain the behaviour of travel times and speeds. We therefore introduce a class of accelerated random walks, validated by empirical observations, where the velocity changes due to acceleration kicks at random times. Combining this mechanism with an exponentially decaying distribution of travel times leads to a short-tailed distribution of distances which could indeed be mistaken with a truncated power law. These results illustrate the limits of purely descriptive models and provide a mechanistic view of mobility.},

Especially in the second half of the twentieth century, we find a pronounced departure from the exact Zipf's law. The city size distribution has become more equally distributed over time. Besides, the applied estimation method reveals evidence for leading cities dominating the remaining largest cities. Thus, the growing equality of the city sizes can be explained rather by growing smaller cities than by a loss of importance of the largest ones.},

	abstract = {Urban scaling relations characterizing how diverse properties of cities vary on average with their population size have recently been shown to be a general quantitative property of many urban systems around the world. However, in previous studies the statistics of urban indicators were not analyzed in detail, raising important questions about the full characterization of urban properties and how scaling relations may emerge in these larger contexts. Here, we build a self-consistent statistical framework that characterizes the joint probability distributions of urban indicators and city population sizes across an urban system. To develop this framework empirically we use one of the most granular and stochastic urban indicators available, specifically measuring homicides in cities of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, three nations with high and fast changing rates of violent crime. We use these data to derive the conditional probability of the number of homicides per year given the population size of a city. To do this we use Bayes{\textquoteright} rule together with the estimated conditional probability of city size given their number of homicides and the distribution of total homicides. We then show that scaling laws emerge as expectation values of these conditional statistics. Knowledge of these distributions implies, in turn, a relationship between scaling and population size distribution exponents that can be used to predict Zipf{\textquoteright}s exponent from urban indicator statistics. Our results also suggest how a general statistical theory of urban indicators may be constructed from the stochastic dynamics of social interaction processes in cities.},

To remedy this difficulty, we construct cities "from the bottom up" by clustering populated areas obtained from high-resolution data. We find that Zipf's law for population holds for cities as small as 5,000 inhabitants in Great Britain and 12,000 inhabitants in the US. We also find a Zipf's law for areas.

It states that, for most countries, the size distributions of city sizes and of firms are power laws with a specific exponent: the number of cities and of firms with sizes greater than S is inversely proportional to S. Zipf's law also holds in many other scientific fields. Most explanations start with Gibrat's law of proportional growth (also known as "preferential attachment'' in the application to network growth) but need to incorporate additional constraints and ingredients introducing deviations from it. This book presents a general theoretical derivation of Zipf's law, providing a synthesis and extension of previous approaches. The general theory is presented in the language of firm dynamics for the sake of convenience but applies to many other systems. It takes into account (i) time-varying firm creation, (ii) firm's exit resulting from both a lack of sufficient capital and sudden external shocks, (iii) the coupling between firm's birth rate and the growth of the value of the population of firms. The robustness of Zipf's law is understood from the approximate validity of a general balance condition. A classification of the mechanisms responsible for deviations from Zipf's law is also offered.},

The solution to a scaling relation equation is always a power law. The scaling laws are followed by many natural and social phenomena such as cities, earthquakes, and rivers. This paper reveals the power law behaviors in systems of natural cities by reconstructing the urban hierarchy with cascade structure. Cities of the U.S.A., Britain, France, and Germany are taken as examples to perform empirical analyses. The hierarchical scaling relations can be well fitted to the data points within the scaling ranges of the number, size and area of the natural cities. The size-number and area-number scaling exponents are close to 1, and the size-area allometric scaling exponent is slightly less than 1. The results show that natural cities follow hierarchical scaling laws very well. The principle of entropy maximization of urban evolution is then employed to explain the hierarchical scaling laws, and differences entropy maximizing processes are used to interpret the scaling exponents. This study is helpful for scientists to understand the power law behavior in the development of cities and systems of cities.},

This paper attempts to argue that geospatial analysis requires a different way of thinking {\textendash} a Paretian way of thinking that underlies skewed distribution such as power laws, Pareto and lognormal distributions. I review two properties of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, and point out that the notion of spatial heterogeneity in current spatial statistics is only used to characterize local variance of spatial dependence or regression. I subsequently argue for a broad perspective on spatial heterogeneity, and suggest it be formulated as a scaling law. I further discuss the implications of Paretian thinking and the scaling law for better understanding geographic forms and processes, in particular while facing massive amounts of social media data. In the spirit of Paretian thinking, geospatial analysis should seek to simulate geographic events and phenomena from the bottom up rather than correlations as guided by Gaussian thinking.},

This paper does not deal with the latter issue with respect to why, and instead investigates whether Zipf{\textquoteright}s law holds in a global setting, thus involving all cities around the world. Unlike previous studies, which have mainly relied on conventional census data such as populations and census-bureau-imposed definitions of cities, we adopt naturally (in terms of data speak for itself) delineated cities, or natural cities, to be more precise, in order to examine Zipf{\textquoteright}s law. We find that Zipf{\textquoteright}s law holds remarkably well for all natural cities at the global level, and it remains almost valid at the continental level except for Africa at certain time instants. We further examine the law at the country level, and note that Zipf{\textquoteright}s law is violated from country to country or from time to time. This violation is mainly due to our limitations; we are limited to individual countries, or to a static view on city-size distributions. The central argument of this paper is that Zipf{\textquoteright}s law is universal, and we therefore must use the correct scope in order to observe it. We further find Zipf{\textquoteright}s law applied to city numbers; the number of cities in the largest country is twice as many as that in the second largest country, three times as many as that in the third largest country, and so on. These findings have profound implications for big data and the science of cities.},

A major problem around this issue is how to define cities or city boundaries. Most of the investigations of Zipf's law rely on the demarcations of cities imposed by census data, for example, metropolitan areas and census-designated places. These demarcations or definitions (of cities) are criticized for being subjective or even arbitrary. Alternative solutions to defining cities are suggested, but they still rely on census data for their definitions. In this article we demarcate urban agglomerations by clustering street nodes (including intersections and ends), forming what we call natural cities. Based on the demarcation, we found that Zipf's law holds remarkably well for all the natural cities (over 2{\textendash}4 million in total) across the United States. There is little sensitivity for the holding with respect to the clustering resolution used for demarcating the natural cities. This is a big contrast to urban areas, as defined in the census data, which do not hold stable for Zipf's law.},

	abstract = {Much of the literature shows that a compact city with well-mixed land use tends to produce lower vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and consequently lower energy consumption and less emissions. However, a significant portion of the literature indicates that the built environment only generates some minor{\textemdash}if any{\textemdash}influence on travel behavior. Through the literature review, we identify four major methodological problems that may have resulted in these conflicting conclusions: self-selection, spatial autocorrelation, inter-trip dependency, and geographic scale. Various approaches have been developed to resolve each of these issues separately, but few efforts have been made to reexamine the built environment-travel behavior relationship by considering these methodological issues simultaneously. The objective of this paper is twofold: (1) to better understand the existing methodological gaps, and (2) to reexamine the effects of built-environment factors on transportation by employing a framework that incorporates recently developed methodological approaches. Using the Seattle metropolitan region as our study area, the 2006 Household Activity Survey and the 2005 parcel and building data are used in our analysis. The research employs Bayesian hierarchical models with built-environment factors measured at different geographic scales. Spatial random effects based on a conditional autoregressive specification are incorporated in the hierarchical model framework to account for spatial contiguity among Traffic Analysis Zones. Our findings indicate that land use factors have highly significant effects on VMT even after controlling for travel attitude and spatial autocorrelation. In addition, our analyses suggest that some of these effects may translate into different empirical results depending on geographic scales and tour types.},

	abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions {\textemdash}density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the {\textquoteleft}3Ds{\textquoteright} affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing {\textquoteleft}walking quality{\textquoteright} was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

These elasticity values may be useful in travel forecasting and sketch planning and have already been incorporated into one sketch planning tool, the Environmental Protection Agency{\textquoteright}s Smart Growth Index model.

Trip frequencies have attracted considerable academic interest of late. They appear to be primarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics of travelers and secondarily a function of the built environment. Trip lengths have received relatively little attention, which may account for the various degrees of importance attributed to the built environment in recent studies. Trip lengths are primarily a function of the built environment and secondarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics. Mode choices have received the most intensive study over the decades. Mode choices depend on both the built environment and socioeconomics (although they probably depend more on the latter). Studies of overall VMT or VHT find the built environment to be much more significant, a product of the differential trip lengths that factor into calculations of VMT and VHT.},

The data come from the 1990 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey. It is found that density matters, but not much. A 10 percent increase in density leads to only a 0.7 percent reduction in household automobile travel. By comparison, a 10 percent increase in household income leads to a 3 percent increase in automobile travel. The results are similar when vehicle trips are used as the dependent variable.

Americans are increasingly sedentary; erstwhile the rate of increase in obesity is alarming. New research suggests that increased auto dependence, and limited opportunities to walk for utilitarian purposes, has contributed to this emerging obesity epidemic. Within sociodemographic strata, land use patterns and transportation investments collectively shape the desire to walk, drive, or to travel via other means. Mixed use and more compact community designs show significant promise for the promotion of physical activity and the reduction of regional air pollution levels. Opportunities exist to increase physical activity and improve regional air quality through more compact development. However, increased compactness, or density, often exacerbates traffic congestion and can increase exposure of harmful emissions within central areas. Therefore, strategies to reduce localized air pollution in existing and developing centers are required to enable larger health benefits from smart growth to be realized.},

Developers, planners, and policy makers regularly debate to what extent the built environment and land use patterns can alleviate roadway congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and myriad other urban problems. A study illustrates the use of Heckman's latent index model to ascertain travel impacts of neighborhood type in Austin, Texas. Under this approach, self-selection is formulated as sample selection bias in receiving a treatment. Here, treatment is defined to be one's residence in a suburban or rural zone, rather than Austin's central business district (CBD) and nearby urban zones. This approach of treatment or no-treatment is a meaningful advance in models of self-selection effects and requires estimation of three straightforward models. Depending on model specification used, results suggest that at least half (58\% to 90\%) of the differences in vehicle miles traveled observed between similar households living in CBD or urban versus rural or suburban neighborhoods of Austin is due to the location or treatment itself, whereas self-selection of such treatment (by households that wish to meet special travel needs or preferences) accounts for the remainder.},

	abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

After controlling for observed confounding influences, both original and new compactness measures are negatively related to BMI, obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Indices are not significantly related to physical activity, perhaps because physical activity is not defined broadly to include active travel to work, shopping, and other destinations.

Higher values represent greater compactness, lower values greater sprawl. The four factors are then combined into an overall compactness/sprawl index. The study then applies factor score coefficient values for 2010 to the same variables for 2000 to create comparable metrics for 2000. Compactness scores for 2000 are compared to the same scores for 2010 to see which UZAs sprawled the most between censuses, and which sprawled the least or actually became more compact. Finally, the study validates the compactness index and its component factors against transportation outcomes for 2010, specifically walk mode share, transit mode share, and average drive time on the journey to work. If sprawl has any widely accepted outcome, it is automobile dependence and heavy automobile use. Consistent with this characterization of sprawl, this study finds that the overall compactness index bears a strong relationship to transportation outcomes. Generalizing across the entire universe of large urbanized areas in the U.S., compactness decreased and sprawl increased between the two census years; but only slightly. Several urbanized areas, however, have significantly different rankings in 2000 than 2010.},

In this study, we develop refined compactness/sprawl indices based on definitions and procedures in earlier studies by Ewing and colleagues and validate them against transportation outcomes.

	abstract = {A decade ago, compactness/sprawl indices were developed for metropolitan areas and counties which have been widely used in health and other research. In this study, we first update the original county index to 2010, then develop a refined index that accounts for more relevant factors, and finally seek to test the relationship between sprawl and traffic crash rates using structural equation modelling. Controlling for covariates, we find that sprawl is associated with significantly higher direct and indirect effects on fatal crash rates. The direct effect is likely due to the higher traffic speeds in sprawling areas, and the indirect effect is due to greater vehicle miles driven in such areas. Conversely, sprawl has negative direct relationships with total crashes and non-fatal injury crashes, and these offset (and sometimes overwhelm) the positive indirect effects of sprawl on both types of crashes through the mediating effect of increased vehicle miles driven. The most likely explanation is the greater prevalence of fender benders and other minor accidents in the low speed, high conflict traffic environments of compact areas, negating the lower vehicle miles travelled per capita in such areas.},

	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Planners commonly recommend compact development in part as a way of getting people to drive less, with the idea that less driving will lead to more sustainable communities. Planners base their recommendations on a substantial body of research that examines the impact of compact development on driving. Different studies, however, have found different outcomes: Some studies find that compact development causes people to drive less, while other studies do not. I use meta-regression analysis to a) explain why different studies on driving and compact development yield different results, and b) combine different findings from many studies into reliable statistics that can better inform planning practice. I address the following questions: Does compact development make people drive less, and if so, how much less? I find that compact development does make people drive less, because most of the compact development features I study have a statistically significant negative influence on driving. The impact, however, is fairly small: Compact development features do not appear to have much influence on driving. My findings are limited to some extent because they are derived from small sample sizes.Takeaway for practice: Planners should not rely on compact development as their only strategy for reducing driving unless their goals for reduced driving are very modest and can be achieved at a low cost.},

Scholars usually assume that their relationships follow a (generalized) linear pattern and are homogeneous over space. These assumptions may lead to inconsistent estimates. This study develops a semi-parametric multilevel mixed logit model to identify non-linear and spatially heterogeneous relationships between built environment attributes and transit commuting in Nanjing, China. The results show that built environment variables in residential areas have saliently non-linear associations with transit commuting, and the associations vary across traffic analysis zones. Densification facilitates transit use but it has a diminishing return. A medium level of mixed-use is conducive to transit commuting. Transit supply has to exceed a certain threshold to be effective. These findings offer nuanced guidance for transit-oriented neighborhood planning.},

We estimate a simultaneous equations system to account for the potential residential self-selection problem. While most previous studies focus on a specific region, this paper uses national samples from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey. The estimation results indicate that residential density has a statistically significant but economically modest influence on vehicle usage, which is similar to that in previous studies. However, the joint effect of the contextual density measure (density in the context of its surrounding area) and residential density on vehicle usage is quantitatively larger than the sole effect of residential density. Moving a household from a suburban to an urban area reduces household annual mileage by 18\%. We also find that a lower neighborhood residential density induces consumer choices toward less fuel-efficient vehicles, which confirms the finding in Brownstone and Golob (2009).},

The land use{\textendash}travel time{\textendash}carbon emission relationship in which the time is specified as a mediator is analyzed at the city level on an international scale based on individually reported data by moving away from the tendency of conducting country-level, regional-scale analysis based on estimates from travel survey data or satellite images. A major finding of the structural equation model is that because of the high population density in their high-density built-up areas, compact developments with urban cores reduce travel, and indirectly lessen CO2 emissions (complete mediation by travel time). In contrast, despite no effect on travel, gross population density in the entire city is found to have a direct effect in reducing per-capita emissions based partially on the economies of scale. The proportion of the low-density built-up area in the city also directly reduces the emissions, which might reinforce the concept of the paradox of intensification. Among the control variables, household size, fuel price, and congestion level may ultimately lead to less CO2 emissions because their direct effects, which are positive on travel time, would be overwhelmed by the negative effects on CO2 emissions.},
