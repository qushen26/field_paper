# Urban Form as Predictors {#form}

The concepts of 'urban form', 'built environment', and 'land use' are often exchangeable in literature.
Adopted from some common usages, here land use refer to 
At the macro scale,, The same thing is about 'land use' and  at the meso and micro scales.
and


## Influencing Direction

Before discussing the impact of land use on travel, the first question is, does land use characteristics is the treatment affecting the outcome of travel behavior? Or the affecting direction is opposite? Technically, randomized experiments can identify the causal relationship between them. But in real life, it is impossible to setup some experimental areas and randomly assign people to live in these areas. Another way is to observe the dynamic of these factors to figure out the direction of influences.

@mullerTransportationUrbanForm2004 reviews the evolution of the U.S. urban form and describe the four eras of intrametropolitan growth (Figure \ref{4age}) in U.S. history: the walking-horsecar era (1800s -- 1890s), the electric streetcar or transit era (1890s -- 1920s), the recreational automobile era (1930s -- 1950s), and the freeway era (1950s -- 2010s) [@rodrigueGeographyTransportSystems2016]. Each of the four-stage urban transportation development has its dominated spatial structure, which is hard represented by other socio-economic concepts. Each era has the distinctive travel mode, range of distance, and land-use patterns. People can see that the innovation of transportation technology is a determining constraint to other factors and a main driving force to launch the next era.

```


New transportation tools shifted people's travel modes, extended travel distance, and reshaped the urban form. In causal inference, the new tools is called confounder or common cause who affect both treatment and outcome. But what is the relationship between travel and land use? A simple way is to observe the sequence fo events to happen. In each transition period, the new tools and new modes began ahead of the new urban development. Even today multiple travel modes exist in old town but suburban seldom has old mode like streetcar. Thus, land use is more like a outcome rather than treatment.

However, the urban form remains relatively more stable than individual's travel behavior in each era. A family may be used to driving in Texas and turn to use the subway when they move to New York and vice versa. Given a period, VMT could be affected by density and other factors. It doesn't make sense that VMT will change the density in the short term. Therefore, land use can be treated as indepedent variables in the context of the current stage of urban development. The relationship of land use with respect to travel can hold for a period of time.

Over the long term, the relationships among travel, land use, and other physical, socioeconomic, demographic factors were interactive and iterative. @levinsonMetropolitanTransportLand2018 emphasize transportation is a necessary but not a sufficient factor for any development. The change of eras is a comprehensive outcome of socioeconomic and technological development. Which factor caused which effect does not have a simple answer. A conservative view is that land use and travel behavior are determined simultaneously by the transportation costs [@pickrellTRANSPORTATIONLANDUSE1999].

Although randomized experiments about travel and land use are impossible, once the simultaneous relationship holds, the regression model still can explore the associations between travel and land use.



## Influencing Factors

For the complexity of travel behavior, many objective or subjective factors could change people's travel decisions. They include but are not limited to physical, socio-demographic, individual, and policy determinants. It seems impossible to make an exhaustive list.
Here briefly introduces several significant influencing factors.

A dichotomy of individual versus environmental factors is a common framework.
All relevant factors involving personal or household characteristics is treated as internal factors. While the built-environment and other environmental factors have external influences.
Disaggregate analysis usually chooses this structure because the models can distinguish the different sources of variation from individual and environmental factors.
Take for example VMT models, the model is as follow.

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{I}\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{I}+\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{E}\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{E}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
\end{aligned}$$

where $\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{I}$ are travelers' internal characteristics; $\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{E}$ are built environment and other environment covariates.

### Individual Factors

Previous research have identified many internal factors such as employment status, income level, lifecycle stage, habits, and preferences, having strong impact on travel. Therefore, a sufficient model should contain these influencing factors. One purpose is to increase the explanatory power. Another purpose is to control self-selection and other independent variables. 

Some major life events, such as transitions to higher school, labor market, marriage, parenthood, retirement, and relocation, could provide windows of opportunity for travel behavior change [@laroucheEffectMajorLife2020]. The results of a scoping review show that relocation prompts people to reflect on their travel behaviors. Entry into the labor market often increases driving while retirement may have more walking or cycling for fewer time constraints. The effects of school transition may have different directions due to the environmental differences. Marriage is not significant because couples may live together before marriage. In a similar way, parents may have more car use several years after childbirth for the purposes of childcare, school, recreation, etc.


-   Income levels

-   Vehicle ownership

-   Working status

-   Major life events/lifecycle

-   Psychological factors

-   Attitude

-   Habit



### Environmental Factors

Environmental factors usually impact a large number of people. Three main categories are socio-economic environment, natural Environment, and built environment.

The natural terrain, temperature, and precipitation could change travelers' choice. 
These factors can only be examined across cities and regions. They are also hard to change and are not included in the models.

Fuel price, crime rates also encourage people choosing driving or not for economic or safety reasons. 
Some factors could be related to the broader topics such as public security, and Automobile Dependency may be the secondary issues in some cases.
Or, Some of them are as hard to measure and control as individual psychological factors, such as car culture.

<!-- Although the internal factors, psychological, socio-demographic, and economic characteristics contribute the primary variation in these models, -->

Infrastructure supplement is also a set of strong explanatory variables. It has been proven that road capacity and parking space are two primary factors for driving. No one doubts this relations. The problem is that reducing supply is painful for public and is subject to political pressure.

Policy environment as treatment applied on a administrative region, such as restrictions on car use, can only be examined by comparing with the 'control groups'.
Meanwhile, transportation policy is a context-dependent factor. 
The same policy in name may be implemented in very different ways across the country.
Cross-sectional study is a challenge because existing the complex interaction effects between a policy and the characteristics of the 'experimental group'.
Longitudinal study and Difference in Difference (DID) methods are more common in policy evaluations.

There are also two types of policies. Travel Demand Management (TDM) heads directly toward change of travel behavior.
While many urban development policies such as UBG, TOD, and rezoning have more comprehensive goals.


The research purpose of travel behavior is not only to explain travel itself, but also to find some tools to affect people's behavior. 
Built environment is the primary focus of attention in urban studies because policy or planning might be able to intervene current and future land use, further achieve the goal of travel behavior change.
"Attributes of the built environment influence travel by making travel to opportunities more or less convenient and attractive" [@domencichURBANTRAVELDEMAND1975; @levinsonElementsAccessTransport2017; @litmanHowLandUse2017].
Some of them such as urban density and design are more acceptable for having neutral meaning and could change people's behavior inadvertently.
Some such as transit services are more welcome and feasible through providing a substitution of driving.

There are many complex unknown interaction effects between built-environment and other variables. Some research found that the habit discontinuity hypothesis, major life events may provide windows of opportunity during which individuals may reconsider their travel behaviors and be more sensitive to behavior change interventions [@verplankenContextChangeTravel2008]. Similarly, 'changes in built environment attributes may be particularly salient for behavior change following relocation.'
Comparing to other factors, built environment are more measurable to be added into the regression model. 
Detailed introduction will be placed in the next section.

<!-- Density is a critical built-environment factor in many theories, research, and policies. For simplicity, the regression models including response VMT and predictor density are called **VMT-density models**. -->

### Density

Density is the first built-environment factor added to the model. Early research of automobile trips and urban density can go back sixty years [@mitchellUrbanTraffic1954]. @levinsonEFFECTSDENSITYURBAN1963 suggest that the people who lived in high-density neighborhoods make fewer automobile trips. This argument stimulated an enormous volume of work. Although later studies construct more complex models, density factor stays in most of built environment-travel model even today.

The most influential aggregate studies start from Newman and Kenworthy. They published a series of studies to show a strong negative correlation between per capita fuel use and gross population density (GPD) [^factors-3]. Their sample covers from thirty-two to fifty-eight global cities [@newmanCITIESAUTOMOBILEDEPENDENCE1989; @newmanEndAutomobileDependence2015] and produced very convincing results. Their research points out the relationship rather than estimating the effect size. In this way, the denser cities have less fuel consumption, which implies less automobile dependence. This is a succinct argument and is widely accepted by planners and policy makers.

[^factors-3]: @newmanCITIESAUTOMOBILEDEPENDENCE1989;@newmanGasolineConsumptionCities1989;@kenworthyINTERNATIONALSOURCEBOOKAUTOMOBILE1999;@newmanUrbanDesignReduce2006;@newmanPeakCarUse2011;@newmanDensityMultiplierResponse2011;@newmanDensitySustainabilityMultiplier2014;@newmanEndAutomobileDependence2015;@kenworthyAutomobileDependenceEmerging2017

The criticisms include their ideological grounds, dataset, and model specification[^factors-4]. A criticism is that, for aggregated data, the population variable on both sides of the equation artificially creates a hyperbolic function (Equation \@ref(eq:hyperbolic)).
In many disaggregated studies, the effects of density are not significant and have a small magnitude. 


[^factors-4]: @gordonGasolineConsumptionCities1989;@dujardinHometoworkCommutingUrban2012;@perumalContextualDensityUS2017



```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 & \text{VMT}_{average}  =\beta\cdot  \text{Density}  +\cdots\\ 
\implies & \frac{\text{VMT}_{total}}{\text{Population}}  = \beta\cdot  \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}}  +\cdots\\
\implies & \text{VMT}_{total} = \beta\cdot  \frac{(\text{Population})^2}{\text{Area}}  +\cdots
\end{split}
(\#eq:hyperbolic)
\end{equation}
```

Another criticism argues that the global comparisons are not valid, such as comparing Hong Kong and Houston. @ewingTestingNewmanKenworthy2018 created a subset with only US Metropolitan areas from @kenworthyPatternsAutomobileDependence1999 's original data set. They fit the same model but get a much lower $R^2$ (0.096) than Kenworthy and Laube's (0.72). A similar work by @fanisThreeStudiesThat2019 shows the low $R^2$ for US cities (0.1838) and European cities (0.2804) when deconstructing Newman and Kenworthy's data by continent. Actually, any research question has its corresponding sampling design. Choosing a cutoff from the whole data often gets a different result. These criticisms are unfair for Kenworthy and Laube's work. But it is true that the US cities have higher VMT and lower density than other countries' cities. Recent evidence over a 20-year period from other cities and counties show that the status quo of the U.S. only represents a small window of the global trend[@kenworthyAutomobileDependenceEmerging2017].

Density variable have some advantages. Density is calculated by population size and area size from census data, which are widely available over the country. In contrast, some individual variables are not as measurable and accurate as density. 
Some studies found density might be an intermediate variable or proxy to other land use variables such as land use mix, street network, and transit services [@ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010; @handyCriticalAssessmentLiterature2005].
The divisions of the statistical units in the U.S. are from an uniform criteria at multiple scales. Thus, density values is more objective, and comparable comparing other measurements. 

Density is an informative factor. Except for the mean and variance, The moments function for Urban density such as skewness, kurtosis, or rank,  all can be the predictor candidates. Scolar also explore more delicate measurements of density such as Propotional Weighted Density to replace overall density. "population-weighted density is equal to conventional density plus the variance of density across the subareas used for its calculation divided by the conventional density" [@ottensmannPopulationWeightedDensity2018]. Some studies use a geographically weighted regression (GWR) ^[@GeographicallyWeightedRegression] procedure to identify significant employment density peaks.

Urban density can be represented by many approximate variables -- built-up density, residential density, employment density, destination density, or CBD density. Here this paper focus on population density -- how many people live in a square mile of land - and involves others if possible.

### D-variables

One trenchant criticism of Newman and Kenworthy's work is that the univariate or bivariate models may leave some critical factors out. In a recent debate [@fanisThreeStudiesThat2019], Newman clarified that "All our work shows that there are multiple causes of car dependence and multiple implications." Since travel behavior is a multi-dimensional issue, more socio-demographic and built environment variables were added to the multivariate analysis. The work started from adding three 'Ds' variables, *density*, *diversity*, and *design* [@cerveroTravelDemand3Ds1997], extended to five 'Ds', adding *destination accessibility* and *distance to transit* [@ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2001]. 
It even grows to seven with the addition of *demand management* and *demographics* (TODO).

Ds' Framework is a significance-centered mixed factor sets and becomes one of the most influential ideas among the built environment--travel literature in the past decades. Using household-level or person-level data, these studies tried to disclose more complex relationships among the candidate factors by adding more relevant variables.

The criticism from @handyEnoughAlreadyLet2018 says the 5Ds variables may not be independent. A meta-analysis found that spatial multicollinearity is widespread in this field [@gimRelationshipsLandUse2013]. Although previous studies usually check multicollinearity issues, these variables still correlate with each other in some ways and may have strong interaction effects. 

### Synthesized Index

To address the multicollinearity and interactions issues, @cliftonGettingHereThere2017 suggest to convert the various environmental characteristics to built environment indices. Some research try to use 'compactness indices' to replace the single density measurement [^47]. The primary method is principal components analysis (PCA) or principal components regression (PCR), which synthesizes many variables to four dimensions: development density, land use mix, activity centering, and street connectivity. The advantage of this method is to increase the elasticity value significantly. A recent study shows that the elasticity of VMT with respect to a county compactness index is -0.78. 
The disadvantage of this method is that the internal mechanisms of the indices are still not clear.
Another disadvantage is that the various indices are not comparable. For example, the Urban Liveability Index (ULI) by @higgsUrbanLiveabilityIndex2019 includes many indicators supporting health and wellbeing. The association between ULI and travel mode choice is a specific result unless it is widely applied on other studies and cities.

A smart application of synthesize method (common factor analysis) is to control the physiological effects in models. @hongHowBuiltenvironmentFactors2014 convert eight attitudinal questions in the 2006 Household Activity Survey to three factors: Ease, Convenience, and Pro-transit. They fit the model using two geographic scales: 1-km buffer and traffic analysis zone (TAZ). After contolling the attitudinal effects, the *nonresidential density* and *distance from CBD* have significant effects on VMT at the TAZ level.

### Meta-Aanalysis

To get a general, comparable outcome, @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010 collect more than 200 related studies and try to summarize the elasticity values using meta-analysis. Elasticity measures the percentage change in response with respect to a 1 percent increase in a predictor. Thus, it is a dimensionless parameter. After screening, sixty-two studies were selected. But divided by modes (VMT, walking, and transit use), only nine studies were used to calculate the weighted-average elasticities of VMT with respect to population density. Of nine papers, six gave zero or insignificant elasticity, while three showed significant negative values (two are -0.04 and one is -0.12). The weighted-average elasticity of job density (sample size = 9) was zero. The largest elasticity of VMT belonged to Destination accessibility, -0.20 with respect to Job accessibility by auto (sample size = 5) and -0.22 with respect to Distance to downtown (sample size = 3). Due to the small sample size, the confidence intervals were not available. The authors call for more relevant studies to refine the results.

@stevensDoesCompactDevelopment2017 also try to explain the different outcomes using a meta-regression method. Based on the results from 37 studies, they found the magnitude of effects is small and suggest that compacting development has a tiny influence on driving. 
His work triggers a new round of discussion [@handyThoughtsMeaningMark2017; @knaapDrivingCompactGrowth2017; @nelsonCompactDevelopmentReduces2017; @manvilleTravelBuiltEnvironment2017; @cliftonGettingHereThere2017]

In @ewingDoesCompactDevelopment2017 's reply, they agreed with the values of elasticity but emphasize that Stevens' results (-0.15 \~ -0.22) are not small actually. In a forthcoming study by Ewing and Cervero, an update elasticity of VMT per capita with respect to density is -0.15 [@ewingTestingNewmanKenworthy2018].
In @stevensResponseCommentariesDoes2017 's response to commentaries , he clarified the research goals and important questions.


After the two milestones for meta-analysis of built environment and travel behavior, a recent update re-examines the post-2010 empirical literature and summarized the most common factors [@astonExploringBuiltEnvironment2021].
They are Density, Urban design, Local land use mix, mono/polycentrism and centrality, and Regional jobs-housing balance
