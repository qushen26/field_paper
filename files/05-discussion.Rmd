## Research Design (Aston et al., 2020)

The results show study design has significant impacts on findings for the relationship between the built environment and transit use. Three methodological recommendations are made for future research:

1. Where applicable, best practice approaches to specification should be adopted. Table 7 assembles best practice approaches according to theory.

2. In the absence of best practice, researchers should use Sensitivity Testing to demonstrate a range of results generated when different methodological choices are made.

3. Study design characteristics associated with significant differences in theoretical consistency or effect size should be further examined to determine whether there is a theoretically plausible reason for favoring certain alternatives. These include:

a. Travel behavior data sources

b. Population segments

c. Transit modes

d. Catchment buffer size and type

## Trend and Dynamic

#### From single layer to Multiple layers

#### From fixed effects to random effects

#### From linear to non-linear models and threshold studies

## Policy implications (The Scales of Intervention)

#### UGB,

#### TOD, and

#### Upzoning

In 2019, Oregon legislators passed the first law (HB2001) in the United States legalizing duplexes on city lots [^24]. 'Missing Middle Housing' (Figure \@ref(fig:MMH)) claims that more middle-dense communities would makeless reliance on cars [^25].

[^24]: $\beta \bar X\left(1-\frac{\bar Y}{n}\right)$ (Ewing and Cervero, 2010)

[^25]: $\lambda_i=\exp[\mathbf{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}]$ (Greene, 2012, eq.18-21)

The goal of making American communities "car free" like some European cities has been widely discussed for many years [^26]. From "Compact City" (1970s), "New Urbanism" (1980s), to "Smart Growth" (1990s), urban planners and researchers agree that less automobile dependence has many benefits including fewer traffic accidents involving injury or fatality, less congestion, less greenhouse gas emission, more active trips and healthier lifestyle [^27]. The controversial part is the role of density. Does density strongly affect VMT - a primary variable representing the degree of automobile dependence? Independently or not? Does the effect exist everywhere or in a specific geographic range?

-   Why "the locational context within an urban region is a more important factor of driving-related behavior than local urban form."

$H_1$: Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) in geography

Discloses the phenomenon but does not fully explain the reason.

$H_2$: Center Limit Theorem (CLT) in statistics

Can explain the individual and local factors are confounded by aggregating.

Can be proved by increasing the sample size.

$H_3$: Gravity or Opportunity theories in Human Mobility

Can be proved by choosing different variable and model comparison.

-   Should the spatial scale be in accordance with the mean (median) of driving distance?

Is the local urban form an internal attribute or external factor?

-   Should the trips be classified by purposes.

All three explanatory frameworks can find supportive evidence. The significant effects of 'population centrality' or ' high-density built-up areas' support 'the 'direct' framework. The disaggregated studies support the 'collaborated' framework. The effects of density are not significant and have a small magnitude. The 'compactness indices' synthesized by density and other built-environment factors play a more important role over VMT. The aggregated studies show that density has a strong effect on VMT at the city scale, implying that the 'respective' framework is correct. Before further discussion, it is necessary to clarify the sources of variation in many studies. If one source is unintentional or mismatched, it should be controlled or corrected. If one source answers one type of question, then the differences are reasonable and should be preserved in categories. This study tries to find the boundaries or criteria for the categorized discussions.

The second source of variation is from the use of different scales. The variables in different units, levels, and metrics may have various characteristics. For example, the personal v.s household's records, block-level v.s city-level density, or daily v.s weekly trips are not identical. A systematic comparison should be conducted at various scales. A more general conclusion may hold if a significant factor appears with a similar effect size repeatedly at all scales. Otherwise, a separate discussion is appropriate.

-   

As an important type of technique, the trip-based model (TBM) and activity-based model (ABM) are very elaborate and widely used. These simulation methods are based on extrapolation and are designed for forecasting the future scenarios. They would not be included in this study.
