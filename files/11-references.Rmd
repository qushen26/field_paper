# Data {#data}


Due to the cost and difficulty of gathering data, it is expected that the data in many studies come from a specific region, period, or group. Partial data may store only pieces of information. Of course, its outcome will only represent the local knowledge rather than the characteristics of the population. 
This fact is a challenge to get any generalized conclusion.
A countrywide or worldwide random sampling dataset can mostly address this issue.
Although people developed more new data-collection techniques and gathered more detailed data in the past years, 
Randomization is still the fundamental requirement for eliminating the bias. 

Identifying the effects of urban form on travel behaviors is harder than proving global warming. Scientists can get Antarctic ice core samples but cannot gather everyone's daily travel records, in part because of personal privacy protections, and in part because of limited techniques for gathering these data. Surveys, traffic flow detection, or event data recorder (EDR) can only capture a small piece of the whole picture. Thus, to get a results without loss of generality, wide-range random-sampling data is a critical condition.

## Travel Survey

National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) [@nhts_2009] is a nationwide travel survey on travel and transportation patterns in the United States, which includes the essential trip variables: number of trips, purpose, modes, VMT, etc.

NHTS conducted in 2001, 2009, and 2017 by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The prior Nationwide Personal Transportation Surveys (NPTS) conducted in 1969, 1977, 1983, 1990, and 1995.

NHTS is a well-designed survey. Some deliberate sampling methods make NHTS data representing the population-level travel characteristics. Although it is not as detailed as the GPS data, as large as the social media data, the advantage of NHTS is it satisfies the fundamental requirement of statistic inference: random sampling.

NHTS data include population density of census tract and gasoline-equivalent gallons consumed per year. Some studies use NHTS data to modeling the automotive CO$_2$ emissions [@kimImpactResidentialDensity2013; @perumalContextualDensityUS2017]. But this dataset doesn't contain enough built environment information and cannot support a full VMT-5Ds variable studies. Some studies add psychological factors such as role preferences, motivations, and expectations in choices to the models. @hongHowBuiltenvironmentFactors2014 use eight attitudinal questions in the 2006 Household Activity Survey and improve the models' $R^2$ over 0.7.

State is the [valid geographic levels](https://nhts.ornl.gov/faq.shtml) to use NHTS data.
Only the Add-on Partner [^add-on], the states and MPOs with more sufficient samples size could conduct valid estimates in smaller levels of geography (e.g., cities, counties).


[^add-on]: 9 add-on Partners in 2001; 20 in 2009; [13 in 2017](<https://www.bts.gov/table-3-2017-nhts-add-partners>)

## Census Data

The new NHTS (2009 and 2017) "weights its person data based on control totals found in the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/census-acs.html)." This provides an opportunity of joining travel data to other demographic, employment, and built environment data.

NHTS is conducted at four units: trip, person, vehicle, and household. While SLD is collected at the Census block group (CBG) level. The attributes can be synthesized at block, tract, county, and city scales by [geographic identifiers](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html) (Table \@ref(tab:geoid)).

In the nested series, one spatial entities can be combined by its lower-level unit. For example, Multnomah county, Oregon is made up of 171 tracts, Tract 56 is made up of 4 block groups, Block Group 2 is made up of 22 blocks. Urban Center at PSU locates inside Block 2014.
Other geographic entities can also combined with small units,
Such as Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) [^42]
and Urban Areas (including 486 Urbanized Areas and 3,087 Urban Clusters in 2010) [^43].

[^42]: there are 384 metropolitan statistical areas and 543 micropolitan statistical areas as of 2020. The 2010 standards provide that each CBSA must contain at least one urban area of 10,000 or more population. Each metropolitan statistical area must have at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more inhabitants. Each micropolitan statistical area must have at least one urban cluster of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 population.

[^43]: 2010 Census Urban and Rural Classification and Urban Area Criteria Urbanized Areas (UAs) of 50,000 or more people; Urban Clusters (UCs) of at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 people. (<https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural/2010-urban-rural.html>)

It allows a cities-to-cities, metro-to-metro comparison with an uniform data source (Figure \@ref(fig:diagram3)).

## Smart Location Database

Smart Location Database (SLD) [@ramsey_smart_2014] is an informative data source covering the entire US. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [conducted SLD](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping) for measuring location efficiency and the built environment. 

2009 NHTS and SLD have the same period and can join together by geographic locations. 
SLD synthesized many data sources in around 2010 including [2010 Census](http://www.census.gov/2010census/data/), 2010 ACS, LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), [InfoUSA](http://www.infousa.com/), [NAVTEQ](http://www.navteq.com/products_data.htm), [PAD-US](http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/), [TOD Database](http://toddata.cnt.org/), [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/). 



SLD have more than 90 variables including 
*'density of development'*), 
*'diversity of land use'*, 
*'street network design'*, 
*'transit service'*, and 
*'accessibility to destinations'*. 
The initial data dimension is 150,145 observations by 192 variables. Hence, the joint datasets contain both trip and built environment information to fit VMT-density models.

The advantage is this dataset has almost reached the finest resolution for travel v.s built environment analysis. 

However, among the 57 Ds variables in SLD, the variables inside each Ds group are highly correlated. A ongoing study chooses only one variable from each D group as below.

> D1B: Gross population density (people/acre) on unprotected land;
> D2A_WRKEMP: Household Workers per Job, by CBG;
  D3a: Total road network density;
  D4b050: Proportion of CBG employment within 1/2 mile of fixed-guideway transit stop;

> D5ar: Jobs within 45 minutes auto travel time, time decay (network travel time) weighted.
> Source:[@ramsey_smart_2014]





## New Data Sources

There are more and more transportation studies using new data sources such as Call Detail Records (CDR), GPS, ICT, Point of Interest (POI), and social media data.
@liuPointofInterestDemandModeling2017 use Point-of-Interest (POI) demand modeling to analyze human mobility patterns. @damianiLocationRelevanceDiversity2020 use trajectory summarization technique for the extraction of the locations of interest high-quality information. Using image recognition techniques, satellite imagery and Street View data provide unprecedented built environment information. The advantage of these new data sources is the high resolution and detailed information. 

As long as the data contain the identifiable variables, combining traditional and new data sources together can largely enrich the information and has tremendous potential to answer VMT-urban form questions.
For example, Point of Interest may represent the number of opportunities of place or utility of place. Although some data have high resolution and plenty of information, the geographic restriction and self-report bias should not be neglected.

However, the enormous amount of emerging data is also a huge challenge. The analysis methods of abstracting out generic information lags behind the data collection. How to eliminate the sample bias in new data sources is another unfinished work.


# Discussion

It is impossible to design a replicable experiment controlling other factors to identify the effects of density. But it is possible to filter out the unsuitable or irreproducible models.

## A Proposed Framework

Related theories say that travel is determined by individual's energy, distance, and city's opportunity. 
A proposed framework is to re-categorize all potential factors by three aspects: budget, distance decay, and benefit/opportunity.
And assign them into multiple spatial scales.

Personal/household characteristics are travel budget that means the ability or willingness to pay for a trip. These factors are always point attribute rather than areal.

A part of built environment factors, such as road connectivity, distance to transit, relate to distance decay and measure how easily people can move. From this perspective, a high local and nearby residential density may lead to greater resistance.

Other built environment and urban form factors could represent the benefit or opportunity. The aggregated measurement only can caupure the variation between cities/regions. For disaggregated data, a complete assessment should evaluate all opportunities inside the daily travel range and their weights for each traveler.


## Policy implications 

- directionality and causality might not matter

Ideally, the causal relationship between built environment and travel is preferred in studies.
But as long as evidences support that these two have significant association, policy makers still can utilize this relation to achieve some social, economic, and environmental goals.

Controlling the effects of self-selection make the research results more convincing.
But from the policy perspective, if a city shows a more desirable travel pattern under a policy intervention, it doesn't matter whether people change their travel behavior or people with different behavior relocated outside or inside this city.

The nomological network among travel behavior, socioeconomic, and built environment factors is iterative and cumulative. Causal inference, such as disentangling residential self-selection,  This study does not indicate .

<!-- Causal Inference and  -->
<!-- simultaneous equation model -->
<!-- fake -->
<!-- common cause -->
<!-- back-door criterion -->

- Policy cost and effect size matter

There are different metrics, such as correlations, coefficients, or elasticities to measure the effect size.
If it is possible, a quantified travel behavior change with respect to per unit of public investment is more attractive for policy maker and public.

- Generalisability and Reproducibility

Scientist always want to find some generalized knowledge and hope it can be reproduced in all places.
It requires a large amongt of evidences and stronger schemes.

When a study can only explain and evaluate the built environment-travel association in a specific city or region, the results are still valuable for this city/region. 
the trip-based model (TBM) and activity-based model (ABM) are designed for forecasting the future scenarios based on the local data.
These simulation methods are very elaborate and widely used.

- The Scales of Intervention

The urban development policies have their spatial scales.
For example, UGB would affect all the people in the metropolitan.

A TOD project, and a neighborhood upzoning may change or not change people's travel behavior who living or working inside the neighborhood.

- A case study

In 2019, Oregon legislators passed the first law (HB2001) in the United States legalizing duplexes on city lots [^a]. 'Missing Middle Housing' (Figure \ref{MMH}) claims that more middle-dense communities would make less reliance on cars [^b].

```

The goal of making American communities "car free" like some European cities has been widely discussed for many years [^26]. From "Compact City" (1970s), "New Urbanism" (1980s), to "Smart Growth" (1990s), urban planners and researchers agree that less automobile dependence has many benefits including fewer traffic accidents involving injury or fatality, less congestion, less greenhouse gas emission, more active trips and healthier lifestyle [^27]. The controversial part is the role of density. Does density strongly affect VMT - a primary variable representing the degree of automobile dependence? Independently or not? Does the effect exist everywhere or in a specific geographic range?

## Other thoughts

Aston et al. (2020) conduct a systematic analysis on study design of built environment-transit research.
Their results show that study design has significant impacts on findings for the relationship between the built environment and transit use. Three methodological recommendations are made for future research:

1. Where applicable, best practice approaches to specification should be adopted. Table 7 assembles best practice approaches according to theory.

2. In the absence of best practice, researchers should use Sensitivity Testing to demonstrate a range of results generated when different methodological choices are made.

3. Study design characteristics associated with significant differences in theoretical consistency or effect size should be further examined to determine whether there is a theoretically plausible reason for favoring certain alternatives. These include:

a. Travel behavior data sources
b. Population segments
c. Transit modes
d. Catchment buffer size and type




Banister (2008) suggests that urban sustainable mobility should be the third principle in addition to derived demand and cost minimization.
