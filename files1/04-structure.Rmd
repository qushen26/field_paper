# Conceptual Frameworks {#struc}

<!-- Model Structures -->

A conceptual framework is "an argument about why the topic one wishes to study matters, and why the means proposed to study it are appropriate and rigorous" [@burkholderResearchDesignMethods2019, Chapter 3]. The topic of this paper -- the association between travel and urban form -- will examine whether the influential concept of compact city can moderate automobile dependency. It matters to the public because the denser, diverse, and well-designed development should be accepted only if this association is solid. If studies find the association is not reliable or is negligible, the relevant urban planning and policymaking would have no reason to continue to advocate the idea of compact development.

Then the primary challenge is to make sure the studies have an appropriate and rigorous framework. @gotschiComprehensiveConceptualFramework2017 analyses the frameworks of 26 studies on active travel behavior. They propose a comprehensive conceptual framework based on three features: choice process, structural scales, and topical domains. This section follows these key features to consider how the current D-variables framework assembles the research elements and explains their relationship.

## Topical Domains

D-variables frameworks include two essential domains: travel and urban form. Previous sections have introduced their roles, measures, and effects in the literature. The framework's contents should be selected and meaningful for the specific research question. For example, mode choice and DVMT are the most common dependent variables for measuring automobile dependency. In this context, fewer studies choose the frequency of trips as the dependent variable. The utility maximization theory tells us a trip as an event must have some 'utility' or 'benefit.' Nobody wants to reduce the personal or social frequency of trips because it reflects the person's activity level or is a sign of urban prosperity. People don't object to a more sustainable way given a fixed number of trips. More shared trips and shorter distances are desirable. Hence mode split and driving distance are the targets in this field. The studies on active travel further focus on mode choice or split. When the research is about trip generation in the four-step model, the frequency of trips is the main target [@tianTrafficGeneratedMixedUse2015; @zhangHouseholdTripGeneration2019]. When researchers assess the environmental impact of driving, they have to find other variables to represent the GHG emissions. @leeComparingImpactsLocal2020 use annual household VMT, fuel efficiency, and CO$_2$ emission factor (e.g., 23.46 lbs per gal suggested by @glaeserGreennessCitiesCarbon2010; 8.78 kg per gal by @perumalContextualDensityUS2017) to estimate the GHG emissions. @bigazziMarginalEmissionFactors2020 indicates that the average emission factors (AEF) should be replaced by marginal emission factors (MEF). But annual VMT is a synthesized variable, and fuel efficiency is a rough estimation. In contrast, @gimAnalyzingCitylevelEffects2021 fixed this issue using a global dataset of CO$_2$ emissions for 343 cities. They add congestion level as the explanatory variable and travel time as a mediator into the SEM model. The downside is that this method can only examine the impact of urban form at the city level. In many cases, available data is the main limitation for contents selection.

It is similar for independent variables. Although the conceptual framework lists each D-variable side by side, the data and methodology may not fully support examining them equally. Inside the urban-form domain, an element could have many options. "Density" has many distinct definitions and measures. Researchers try different versions of density to find the best one. Some D-variables are the opposite. "Design" covers many meanings, but its feasible measures are limited, especially at macro scales. Urban design is not just road network design. There could be distinct patterns and structures even for the same road network density. In a comprehensive travel-urban form study assessment, @handyCriticalAssessmentLiterature2005 argues that density is a proxy variable for active travel and should be replaced by other variables like accessibility that directly affect travel. She suggests exploring more quantitative measures from the existing urban design literature to improve the framework.

The D-variable framework does not refuse but does not specify the domains other than urban form. Besides D-variables, other external and internal factors should be fully considered. @handyCriticalAssessmentLiterature2005 calls for a broader conceptual framework including both objective and perceived urban-form factors. And the travelers' preferences and perceptions are also should be involved. She further suggests that controlling the changes of travelers and urban form is necessary for a quasi-experimental design, such as relocation, infrastructure improvement, and planned development projects.

## Structural Scales

The scales of studies and the topical domains are related. When conducting a cross-sectional countrywide survey, factors such as fuel price and heating/cooling degree days are critical. But when the research is a case study for a metropolitan area, controlling these macro-level factors becomes useless because all travelers or TAZs share the same external factors. The same factor, like CBD density, is an internal characteristic at the city level. But at the lower level, CBD density becomes an external factor. For individual-level data, missing the socio-demographic characteristics and psychological factors could lead to underfitting severe such as very low $R^2$. Similarly, individual preferences and psychological effects are confounded when a research scale rises to census tract or TAZ levels. As discussed in the section on Spatial Scales, the aggregated measures such as average income will have different meanings at the new scales.

Researchers try to cover the physical and social determinants at multi-levels [@ewingTrafficGeneratedMixedUse2011, Fig.3]. Under this framework, each level has its specific influential factors (Figure \@ref(fig:Mscale)). In recent years, increasing studies have used the multi-scales frameworks to the micro-, meso, and macro-scale variables [@dingInfluencesBuiltEnvironment2017; @leeComparingImpactsLocal2020; @zhangWhenContextMeets2020]. These studies claim that multi-scales frameworks can better distinguish the effects of local and regional factors.

Multi-scales study has higher requirements for the data sources and variable selection. A macro-scale analysis should contain many cities or regions. Such kinds of data sources often lack detailed information on perceived measures. Various policy environments across regions are also hard to identify and control. At the mesoscale, the observations are often conceptual areas like tracts and TAZs rather than real entities. The meaning of a tract or TAZ is abstract and hard to interpret. Whether the averages aggregated from lower levels can adequately represent a TAZ's feature is a question that should be answered. Moreover, when the data structure includes many geographic groups, the sample size in each subgroup should be large enough.

And $\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{U}$, $\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{N}$, and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{H}$ are corresponding coefficients, respectively. -->

## Choice Process

There are different perspectives to understand the travel choice process. When the travel behavior itself is the research target, a common framework originates in bounded rational behavior and TPB (Figure \@ref(fig:choiceprocess)). This framework focus on the decision mechanism and the subjective factors.

(ref:choiceprocess) Generic choice process for active travel-related behavioral decisions by @gotschiComprehensiveConceptualFramework2017

```{r choiceprocess,eval=T,out.width='50%', fig.align='center',fig.cap=" (ref:choiceprocess) "}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/gotschiComprehensiveConceptualFramework2017.png")
```

A discrete travel choice process is a decision tree from the objective perspective. A tree framework allows a hierarchical structure and covers different dependent variables (Figure \@ref(fig:Tree)). A similar figure can be found in @ewingTrafficGeneratedMixedUse2011 's Figure .1. The tree starts from a travel demand or purpose. The traveler decides to make a trip or not at the first-level dichotomous node. <!-- A logit or probit model will fit all the data using a suitable model specification. --> Then, the second layer with polychotomous nodes is about mode choice from available alternatives based on benefit, cost, and habit. At the bottom layer, each mode has the corresponding variables such as the driving route, distance, or time under the driving node. This process is step-by-step, iterative, and habitual in real life. The tree structure can reflect the overall travel pattern. For example, a person has only short driving trips. Another one takes more buses but makes a long drive occasionally. The mode-only or VMT-only framework may only capture a single side for these two different patterns. The tree structure can also include no-trip or no-driving cases into the models [@ewingVaryingInfluencesBuilt2015]. Remarkably, the covariates set could vary in different model layers. It doesn't require a set of independent variables to explain all dependent variables. For example, the lifecycle factor could strongly affect travel frequency but not significantly driving distance. Therefore, this structure is more flexible and is consistent with the actual decision process.

The framework could be a multistage structure when observing the choice process over time. @ben-akivaMethodologyShortRangeTravel1977a introduced a hierarchical framework of travel behavior. The length of time in travel decisions divided the relevant factors into long, medium, and short-range decisions (Figure \@ref(fig:Mstage)). For example, people often change their non-work travel mode choice for each day or trip. Thus non-work mode choice is a short-term decision. In contrast, commuting trips usually have stable mode choice and fall into the medium-term decision. Car ownership belongs to medium-term decisions since people typically don't purchase or sell a car very often. Residential location and workplace choice are the long-term decisions because relocation and changing jobs are infrequent than above. Researchers can choose one or two stages in this process. The long and medium terms decisions work well on commuting trips because people will not often change the workplace. The mobility theories also agree with this pattern. "commuting trips are stable in time and account for the largest fraction of the total flows in a population." [@vanackerCommutingTripsTours2011].

Under this framework, urban form is the overall external environment and impacts all decisions. The decisions in the long term can affect that in the short term, not vice versa. For example, the distance to the destination is decided by residential and working location choices. And travel distance is further a fundamental factor influencing short-term travel mode choice behavior [@munshiBuiltEnvironmentMode2016]. In this way, household car ownership, travel distance, and mode to work are considered intermediate variables connecting the urban form and mode choice in decision models. [@dingExploringInfluenceBuilt2017; @devosIndirectEffectBuilt2021]. Meanwhile, the number of weekdays commute trips in the U.S. are less than one-third of total trips in many years [source: @nhts_2009]. For non-work travel purposes, such as shopping, leisure, or socializing, short-term decisions such as frequency, mode, and destination choices are also critical.

<!-- There could be a two-way interaction effect between long-term and medium-term variables; three-way interaction effects among long-term, medium-term and short-term variables in the model. -->

<!-- After introducing the urban-form factors and the features of travel variables, the role -->

<!-- This section introduces several different frameworks for travel-urban form analysis based on related theories and studies.  -->

<!-- The three explanatory frameworks introduced in this section can find supportive evidence and reflect the cognitive differences in travel-urban form studies. This section does not intend to figure out all possible frameworks or the 'best' framework. It demonstrates the structures from various perspectives would lead to distinct models and results. -->

<!-- ## Multistage -->

<!-- A VMT model with the stepwise framework is as follows. -->

<!-- ```{=tex} -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->

<!-- (\#eq:stepwise) -->

<!-- \mathrm{Y}=\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{L}\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{L}+\mathrm{X_{M}}{\beta}_\mathrm{M}+\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{S}\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{S}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} -->

<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ are the coefficients concerning long-term factors $\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{L}$, medium-term $\mathrm{X_{M}}$, and short-term covariates $\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{S}$. -->

<!-- (Equation @ref(eq:stepwise)). -->

<!-- ## Decision Tree -->

<!-- @ref(eq:Tree) --> <!-- ```{=tex} --> <!-- \begin{equation} --> <!-- \begin{split} --> <!-- E[\mathbf{Y}_{\{yes,no\}}|\mathbf{X_0}]=&\boldsymbol{\mu_0}=g^{-1}(\mathbf{X_0}\boldsymbol{\beta})\\ --> <!-- E[\mathbf{Y}_{\{car,bus,...\}}|\mathbf{X_1},\mathbf{Y}_{\{yes\}}]=&\boldsymbol{\mu_1}=g^{-1}(\mathbf{X_1}\boldsymbol{\gamma})\\ --> <!-- \mathbf{Z}_{\{car\}}=&\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{2}\boldsymbol{\delta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} --> <!-- \end{split} --> <!-- (\#eq:Tree) --> <!-- \end{equation} --> <!-- ``` --> <!-- Where $\mathbf{Y}_{\{yes,no\}}$ is a binary variable of making a trip or not. $\mathbf{Y}_{\{car,bus,...\}}$ is a categorical variable only including the cases of making a trip. $\mathbf{Z}_{\{car\}}$ is a continuous variable representing driving distance among the group of choosing driving. $\mathbf{X}_{\{0,1,2\}}$ means the three equations could have different model specifications and estimate corresponding coefficients, $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$, and $\boldsymbol{\delta}$. -->

<!-- -   The types of trip variables and the proposed probability distributions -->

<!--     -   Binary: Choose/not to make trip (Bernoulli/Binomial), -->

<!--     -   Polychotomous: modes (Multinomial) and trajectory (Network) -->

<!--     -   Counts: the number of trips (Poisson or NB), -->

<!--     -   Positive continuous: distance and time (Exponential Family: Normal, Log-normal, Power-law, Gamma, Weibull); -->

<!-- -   The unit: Individual or aggregated (household, areal); -->

<!-- -   The temporal scales: Real-time, hourly, Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly/annual, or decade; -->

<!-- -   The spatial scales: Community, city, region, country-wide/national -->

<!-- -   Other taxonomy/division may include -->

<!--     -   traveler roles (returner or explorer); -->

<!--     -   trip purposes; -->

<!--     -   long/short distance/time of trips. -->

<!-- The trip responses are defined in different units, scales, metrics. -->

<!-- ## Other Structures -->

<!-- - Mixed Model -->

<!-- Regression models usually assume the fixed effects of covariate on response. In many cases, some variables should be assigned with random effects.(Equation @ref(eq:mixed)) -->

<!-- In travel survey data, every observation are nested in some geographic units, such as tract, TAZ, or city [@dingInfluencesBuiltEnvironment2017]. -->

<!-- The geographic location often have some nature of artificial feature influencing travel but the factor is unknown or unobserved. -->

<!-- When the data across many different regions, the model need to control the location effect to identify the crossed effect of built environment. For example, the hypothesis is whether density variable has a strong effects on travel in all place. -->

<!-- In spatial analysis, autocorrelation is a common issue which means the observation values in a location will be affected by its neighbors. Mixed model can help to eliminate the neighborhood effects. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->

<!-- (\#eq:mixed) -->

<!-- \mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{H}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{N}{\gamma}+\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{U}{\delta}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} -->

<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- where $\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{U}$, $\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{N}$, and $\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{H}$ are the same as above. $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of fixed effects. $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ and $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ are two vectors of random effects at neighborhood and urban scales. Assume that $\boldsymbol{\gamma}\sim N(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\mathrm{N})$ and $\boldsymbol{\delta}\sim N(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\mathrm{U})$. And also assume $Cov(\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\delta})=Cov(\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})=Cov(\boldsymbol{\delta},\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})=\mathbf{0}$. -->

<!-- - Non-linear models -->

<!-- As @cliftonGettingHereThere2017 said, built environment-travel studies often assume the linearity holds for the density measures and the travel outcome of interest. In practice, the relationship of trip vesus built environment variables may be non-linear or follow a step function with lower and upper threshold. The shape of the curve is highly informative. Recently, scholars have an increasing interest in the non-parameter methods [@dingNonlinearAssociationsZonal2021]. The overall effects of density might be small. But the curve might have a steep rise or sheer drop in some intervals. The inflection points, called effective thresholds, are more attractive and instructional. For example, Using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) [@hastieGeneralizedAdditiveModels1990], @ewingReducingVehicleMiles2020 's study finds some potential points of encouraging shorter driving. His study recommended the suitable activity density (population and employment size/square mile) should be between 10000-25000 according to a center type (Figure @ref(fig:ewing-gam)). -->

<!-- More and more studies reveal the non-linear relationship between population density and VMT [@chengExaminingNonlinearBuilt2020; @dingApplyingGradientBoosting2018]. -->

<!-- People can interpret the different trends as trigger effects, ceiling effects, U-shapes, hybrid, or synergy effect. -->

<!-- (ref:ewingWebinarTransportationBenefits2021) Activity density v.s its smooth function. [@ewingWebinarTransportationBenefits2021] -->

<!-- ```{r ewing-gam,eval=T,out.width='50%', fig.align='center',fig.cap="(ref:ewingWebinarTransportationBenefits2021)"} -->

<!-- knitr::include_graphics("fig/Ewing_gam1.png") -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->

<!-- (\#eq:nonlinear) -->

<!-- \mathrm{Y}=\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{C}\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{C}+m(\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{E})\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{E}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} -->

<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- In the model (Equation @ref(eq:nonlinear)), $m(\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{E})$ is a proper function of built environment covariates.  -->

<!-- The non-linear methods can better perform goodness-of-fit, but the generated new data are unique and harder to interpret. The non-linear methods can disclose more information from the data. The risk is that their results are more likely to reflect the features of the data itself and cannot be generalized to other cases. -->

<!-- The results of linear and non-linear models cannot be compared because their underlying assumptions of distribution are different. The threshold studies in urban transportation field remain in the early stages.  -->
