# Urban Form as Predictors {#form}

In literature, the concepts of 'urban form,' 'built environment,' and 'land use' are often exchangeable. Adopted from some common usages, 'urban form' refers to the comprehensive physical expression of land use at the macro scale. 'Built environment' emphasizes the urban form attributes as a series of external factors opposite travelers' internal characteristics and is often used in disaggregate studies at mesoscale. When using 'urban form' and 'built environment,' one looks at them as the given conditions of travel decision. While 'land use' can represent either current status descriptions or designated future use at mesoscale and micro scales.

## Influencing Direction

Before discussing the impact of land use on travel, the first question is whether land-use characteristics affect the outcome of travel behavior? Or the affecting direction is opposite? Technically, randomized control experiments can identify the causal relationship between them. But in real life, it is impossible to set up some experimental areas and randomly assign people to live in these areas.

Another way is to observe the dynamic of these factors to figure out the direction of influences. @mullerTransportationUrbanForm2004 reviews the evolution of the U.S. urban form and describe the four eras of intra-metropolitan growth (Figure \@ref(fig:4age)) in U.S. history: the walking-horsecar era (the 1800s -- 1890s), the electric streetcar or transit era (1890s -- 1920s), the recreational automobile era (1930s -- 1950s), and the freeway era (1950s -- 2010s) [@rodrigueGeographyTransportSystems2016]. Each four-stage urban transportation development has its dominated spatial structure, which is hard represented by other socio-economic concepts. Each era has a distinctive travel mode, distance range, and land-use patterns. People can see that the innovation of transportation technology is a determining constraint to other factors and a main driving force to launch the next era.

knitr::include_graphics("fig/one_hour_commmuting2.png")
```

New transportation tools shifted people's travel modes, extended travel distance, and reshaped the urban form. In causal inference, the new tools are called confounder or common cause, affecting treatment and outcome. But what is the relationship between travel and urban form? A simple way is to observe the sequence of events to happen. In each transition period, the new tools and modes began ahead of the new urban development. Even today, multiple travel modes exist in the old town, but suburban seldom has the old way like the streetcar. Thus, urban form is more like an outcome rather than treatment.

However, the urban form remains relatively more stable than an individual's travel behavior in each era. A family may be used to driving in Texas and turn to use the subway when they move to New York and vice versa. Given a period, VMT could be affected by density and other factors. It doesn't make sense that VMT will change the density in the short term. Therefore, the urban form can be treated as independent variables in the context of the current stage of urban development. The relationship of urban form concerning travel can hold for a period of time.

Over the long term, the relationships among travel, urban form, and other physical, socio-economic, demographic factors were interactive and iterative. @levinsonMetropolitanTransportLand2018 emphasize transportation is a necessary but not a sufficient factor for any development. The change of eras is a comprehensive outcome of socio-economic and technological development. Which factor caused which effect does not have a simple answer. A conservative view is that land use and travel behavior are determined simultaneously by the transportation costs [@pickrellTRANSPORTATIONLANDUSE1999].

Although randomized control experiments about travel and urban form are impossible, the regression model can still explore their associations once the simultaneous relationship holds.

## Influencing Factors

For the complexity of travel behavior, many objective or subjective factors could change people's travel decisions. They include but are not limited to physical, socio-demographic, individual, and policy determinants. It seems impossible to make an exhaustive list. Here briefly introduces several significant influencing factors.

A dichotomy of individual versus environmental factors is a common framework. All relevant factors involving personal or household characteristics can be categorized as internal factors. In comparison, the built environment and other environmental factors have external influences. Disaggregate analysis usually chooses this structure because the models can distinguish the different sources of variation from individual and environmental factors. For example, the VMT model is as follows.

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{I}\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{I}+\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{E}\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mathrm{E}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
\end{aligned}$$

where $\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{I}$ are travelers' internal characteristics; $\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{E}$ are built environment and other environment covariates.

### Individual Factors

Previous researchers have identified many internal factors that have substantial impacts on travel. Vehicle ownership is a good indicator for choosing the auto mode and longer travel distance [@vanderwaardNewDriversMobility2013]. Employment status or entry into the labor market often increases driving while retirement may have more walking or cycling for fewer time constraints [@goodwinPeakCarThemes2013; @grimalStagnationIndividualCar2013; @headicarChangingSpatialDistribution2013].

Some factors show significant impacts on travel but give opposite directions. Sometimes, it implies some nonlinear features. For example, income usually positively correlates with car ownership and driving distance. But some studies find less-wealthy groups have more cars and longer driving distances [@goetzkeSeparatingContextualEndogenous2012]. Sometimes, it depends on the location and social background. @dargayVolatilityCarOwnership2007 find the number of children in a household has a positive relationship in the U.K. While @dingExploringInfluenceBuilt2017 find a negative effect in the U.S.

@laroucheEffectMajorLife2020 make a scoping review of some major life events on travel behavior. They provide some explanation for the inconsistent results. Relocation offers windows of opportunity for travel behavior change, but the direction depends on people's attitudes. Psychological factors such as travelers' habits and preferences are determinants. Similarly, the choice after school transitions depends on the new environmental factors. Marriage is not significant because couples may live together before marriage. Likewise, parents may have more car use several years after childbirth for childcare, school, recreation, etc.

Therefore, a well-performed model should contain these influencing factors to increase models' fitness. Controlling these independent variables, which can not be intervened by policy, can help identify how large the effect sizes of modifiable factors are. These studies also note that the range, location, and understanding of internal variables are critical for a proper model.

### Environmental Factors

Environmental factors usually impact a large number of people. These factors can be divided into three main categories: natural environment, socio-economic environment, and the built environment. The natural terrain, temperature, and precipitation could change travelers' choices. These factors can only be examined across cities and regions. They are also hard to change and are not included in many studies.

Socio-economic environments such as fuel prices and crime rates also encourage/discourage people from choosing to drive for economic or safety reasons. Some of them, such as car culture, are hard to measure and control as other psychological factors. Some factors could be related to broader topics such as quality of life or public security. In these cases, car usage is not the core concern.

Infrastructure supplement is also a set of solid explanatory variables. It has been proven that road capacity and parking space are two primary factors for driving. @chatmanDeconstructingDevelopmentDensity2008 finds the effect of denser development on VMT is neutral after controlling the road service and parking demand. The problem is that reducing supply is painful for the public and is subject to political pressure. Increasing and improving transit services are more attractive by substituting driving [@kuhnimhofWhoMadePeak2013].

Policy environment as treatments applied on an administrative region, such as restrictions on car use, can only be examined by comparing with the 'control groups.' Meanwhile, transportation policy is a context-dependent factor. The same policy in the name may be implemented in very different ways across the country. The cross-sectional study is a challenge because of the complex interaction effects between a policy and the characteristics of the 'experimental group.' Longitudinal study and Difference in Difference (DID) methods are more common in policy evaluations. There are also two types of policies. Travel Demand Management (TDM) heads directly toward changing travel behavior. For example, studies find parking management and low ticket fare can attract more transit passengers through subsidies[@grimalStagnationIndividualCar2013]. While many urban development policies such as UBG, TOD, and rezoning have more comprehensive goals.

Built environment such as urban density and design is a primary focus of attention in urban studies because they are more changeable than the natural environment. They are measurable and straightforward for implementation. They are more acceptable for neutral meaning and inadvertently change people's behavior.

Policy or planning might intervene in current and future land use, further achieving the goal of travel behavior change. "Attributes of the built environment influence travel by making travel to opportunities more or less convenient and attractive" [@domencichURBANTRAVELDEMAND1975; @levinsonElementsAccessTransport2017; @litmanHowLandUse2017]. Many complex unknown interaction effects exist between the built environment and other variables. Some research found that major life events may provide windows of opportunity in the habit discontinuity hypothesis. Individuals may reconsider their travel behaviors and be more sensitive to behavior change interventions [@verplankenContextChangeTravel2008]. The changes in built-environment attributes may capture these windows of opportunity. The further introduction is placed in the next section.

### Density

Density is the first built-environment factor added to the model. Early research of automobile trips and urban density can go back sixty years ago [@mitchellUrbanTraffic1954]. @levinsonEFFECTSDENSITYURBAN1963 suggest that the people who live in high-density neighborhoods make fewer automobile trips. This argument stimulated an enormous volume of work. Although later studies construct more complex models, the density factor stays in most travel-urban form models even today.

The most influential aggregate studies start from Newman and Kenworthy. They published a series of studies to show a strong negative correlation between per capita fuel use and gross population density (GPD) [^form-1]. Their sample covers from thirty-two to fifty-eight global cities [@newmanCITIESAUTOMOBILEDEPENDENCE1989; @newmanEndAutomobileDependence2015] and produces compelling results. Their research points out the relationship rather than estimating the effect size. In this way, the denser cities have less fuel consumption, implying less automobile dependence. This is a concise argument and is widely accepted by planners and policymakers.

[^form-1]: @newmanCITIESAUTOMOBILEDEPENDENCE1989;@newmanGasolineConsumptionCities1989;@kenworthyINTERNATIONALSOURCEBOOKAUTOMOBILE1999;@newmanUrbanDesignReduce2006;@newmanPeakCarUse2011;@newmanDensityMultiplierResponse2011;@newmanDensitySustainabilityMultiplier2014;@newmanEndAutomobileDependence2015;@kenworthyAutomobileDependenceEmerging2017

The criticisms include their ideological grounds, dataset, and model specification[@gordonGasolineConsumptionCities1989; @dujardinHometoworkCommutingUrban2012; @perumalContextualDensityUS2017]. A criticism is that, for aggregated data, the population variable on both sides of the equation artificially creates a hyperbolic function (Equation \@ref(eq:hyperbolic)). In many disaggregate studies, density effects are insignificant and have a small magnitude [@zhaoRethinkingDeterminantsVehicle2021].

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 & \text{VMT}_{average}  =\beta\cdot  \text{Density}  +\cdots\\ 
\implies & \frac{\text{VMT}_{total}}{\text{Population}}  = \beta\cdot  \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area Size}}  +\cdots\\
\implies & \text{VMT}_{total} = \beta\cdot  \frac{(\text{Population})^2}{\text{Area Size}}  +\cdots
\end{split}
(\#eq:hyperbolic)
\end{equation}
```
Another criticism argues that the global comparisons are not valid, such as comparing Hong Kong and Houston. @ewingTestingNewmanKenworthy2018 created a subset with only U.S. Metropolitan areas from @kenworthyPatternsAutomobileDependence1999 's original data set. They fit the same model but get a much lower $R^2$ (0.096) than Kenworthy and Laube's (0.72). Similar work by @fanisThreeStudiesThat2019 shows the low $R^2$ for U.S. cities (0.1838) and European cities (0.2804) when deconstructing Newman and Kenworthy's data by continent. Any research question has its corresponding sampling design. Choosing a cutoff from the whole data often gets a different result. These criticisms are unfair to Kenworthy and Laube's work. But U.S. cities indeed have higher VMT and lower density than other countries' cities. Recent evidence of other cities and counties over 20 years show that the status quo of the U.S. only represents a small window of the global trend[@kenworthyAutomobileDependenceEmerging2017].

Density as an explanatory variable has some advantages. Density is calculated by population size and area size from census data, widely available over the country. In contrast, some individual variables are not as measurable and accurate as density. Some studies found density might be an intermediate variable or proxy to other land-use variables such as land use mix, street network, and transit services [@ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010; @handyCriticalAssessmentLiterature2005]. The divisions of the statistical units in the U.S. are from uniform criteria at multiple scales. Thus, density values are more objective and comparable comparing other measurements.

Density is an informative factor. Except for the mean and variance, The moments function for urban density, such as skewness, kurtosis, or rank, can all be the predictor candidates. Scholars also explore more delicate measurements of density such as Proportional Weighted Density to replace overall density. "population-weighted density is equal to conventional density plus the variance of density across the subareas used for its calculation divided by the conventional density" [@ottensmannPopulationWeightedDensity2018]. Some studies use a geographically weighted regression (GWR) procedure to identify significant employment density peaks. <!-- [@GeographicallyWeightedRegression] --> Urban density can be represented by many approximate variables -- built-up density, residential density, employment density, destination density, or CBD density. This paper focuses on population density -- how many people live in a square mile of land - and involves others if possible.

### D-variables

One trenchant criticism of Newman and Kenworthy's work is that the univariate or bivariate models may leave some critical factors out. In a recent debate [@fanisThreeStudiesThat2019], Newman clarified that "All our work shows that there are multiple causes of car dependence and multiple implications." Since travel behavior is a multi-dimensional issue, more socio-demographic and built-environment variables were added to the multivariate analysis. The work started by adding three D-variables, *density*, *diversity*, and *design* [@cerveroTravelDemand3Ds1997] extended to five 'Ds,' adding *destination accessibility* and *distance to transit* [@ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2001]. It even grows to seven with the addition of *demand management* and *demographics*.

The idea of D-variables is from some urban planning and transportation theories such as "smart growth" and "new urbanism." To address the urban sprawl, A "compact city" should be denser than a typical suburban development [@schimekHouseholdMotorVehicle1996; @zhangHouseholdTripGeneration2019]. Mixed land use could build a sense of community and allow more external trips to be replaced by internal trips [@ewingTrafficGeneratedMixedUse2011; @tianTrafficGeneratedMixedUse2015]. The transit-oriented development (TOD) could reduce the distance to transit and encourage people to drive less and choose active modes [@mcneilRevisitingTODsHow2020]. Each variable may explain a part of travel behavior in some way.

Ds' framework is a significance-centered mixed factor set and has become one of the most influential ideas in travel-built environment literature in the past decades. Using household-level or person-level data, these studies tried to disclose more complex relationships among the candidate factors by adding more relevant variables. This paper can not list all of the vast travel-urban form literature. A highlight is the results from many studies are mixed. A factor may significantly impact travel in some studies while not in others, or even has different influencing directions. For example, the effect of population density on bus trips is positive in the study by @brownUnderstandingTransitRidership2014, while it is negative in @alamFactorsAffectingTravel2018 's study.

A criticism from @handyEnoughAlreadyLet2018 is that the D-variables may not be independent. A meta-analysis found that spatial multicollinearity is widespread in this field [@gimRelationshipsLandUse2013]. Although previous studies usually check multicollinearity issues, these variables still correlate with each other in some ways and may have strong interaction effects.

### Synthesized Index

\@cliftonGettingHereThere2017 suggests converting the various environmental characteristics to built environment indices to address the multicollinearity and interactions issues. Some research tries to use 'compactness indices' to replace the single density measurement [@ewingRelationshipUrbanSprawl2014; @hamidiLongitudinalStudyChanges2014; @hamidiMeasuringSprawlIts2015; @ewingUrbanSprawlRisk2016]. The primary method is Principal Components Analysis (PCA) or Principal Components Regression (PCR), which synthesizes many variables into four dimensions: development density, land use mix, activity centering, and street connectivity. The advantage of this method is to increase the elasticity value significantly. A recent study shows that the elasticity of VMT with respect to a county compactness index is -0.78. The disadvantage of this method is that the internal mechanisms of the indices are still not clear. Another disadvantage is that the various indices are not comparable. For example, @zhangHouseholdTripGeneration2019 use urban living infrastructure (ULI) as the local accessibility variable (ULI) and find that ULI and household density significantly affect household trip generation. Their ULI is the count number of retail, services, and social activities. Meanwhile, the Urban Liveability Index (ULI) by @higgsUrbanLiveabilityIndex2019 are some indices supporting health and wellbeing. These indices include social infrastructure, transit service, walkability, public open space, housing, and employment. The two ULI have different information and may not be comparable. Hence, the association between ULI and travel mode choice is a specific result unless a uniform measurement is widely applied to other studies and cities.

A smart application of synthesizing method (common factor analysis) is to control the psychological effects in models. @hongHowBuiltenvironmentFactors2014 convert eight attitudinal questions in the 2006 Household Activity Survey to three factors: Ease, Convenience, and Pro-transit. They fit the model using two geographic scales: 1-km buffer and traffic analysis zone (TAZ). After controlling the attitudinal effects, the *nonresidential density* and *distance from CBD* have significant impacts on VMT at the TAZ level.

## Meta-Analysis

This section introduces several influencing meta-analyses of travel-urban form studies. The relevant methods are in a separate chapter of Part II.

-   @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010

To get a general, comparable outcome, @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010 collected more than 200 related studies and summarized the elasticity values using meta-analysis. They exclude the aggregated studies to avoid "ecological fallacies." The studies on specific groups such as aged people are also excluded. The selected studies must use multiple regression analysis with at least one response of VMT or travel modes, with at least one predictor from 5D variables. The studies using structural equation models are not included because these models will not give a single effects size of each D-variable. The coefficients concerning various metrics of predictors are incomparable. Thus they convert all the estimates of the coefficient to elasticities. Elasticity measures the percentage change in response to a 1 percent increase in a predictor. Therefore, it is a dimensionless parameter.

After screening, sixty-two studies were selected. This is a tiny sample size because the research question involves five predictors (5D-variables) and three responses (VMT, walking, and transit use). For example, for the VMT-density relationships, only nine selected studies in this meta-analysis. It is not large enough to get a sufficient inference. Looking at the distribution of elasticities, six of nine papers gave zero or insignificant elasticity. Three studies showed significant negative values (two are -0.04 and one is -0.12). @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010 use the nine observation to calculate the weighted-average elasticities of VMT concerning population density. The three observations mainly determine the result of -0.04.

Moreover, among the nine VMT-density studies, eight use single city/metro data. Only one nationwide study using NPTS data [@schimekHouseholdMotorVehicle1996] finds logarithm of household VMT has a non-significant elasticity (-0.07).

Similarly, in this meta-analysis, the weighted-average elasticity of job density (sample size = 9) was zero. The most extensive elasticities of VMT are -0.20 concerning job accessibility by auto (sample size = 5) and -0.22 concerning distance to downtown (sample size = 3).

For the limitation of data quality, the standard errors of elasticities are not included in this meta-analysis. When calculating the weighted-average values, @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010 use each study's sample size as the weight factor. For the same reason, the confidence intervals are also not available.

```

This meta-analysis kindled researchers' enthusiasm for this topic. After that, some studies try to cover multi-region data [@zhangHowBuiltEnvironment2012]. @ewingVaryingInfluencesBuilt2015 accumulated a travel-built environmental dataset from 23 metropolitan regions in the U.S. (81,056 households and 815,204 people). They find that all 11 D-variables have statistically significant effects on VMT.

-   @stevensDoesCompactDevelopment2017

@stevensDoesCompactDevelopment2017 extends this analysis and explains the different outcomes using a meta-regression method. He focuses on the studies with VMT as the response and uses similar screening criteria. Based on the results from 37 studies, he finds the elasticity of population density is small (-0.10) and suggests that compacting development has a minor influence on driving.

Adding a dummy variable, whether a study control residential self-selection or not, into the meta-regression, \@stevensDoesCompactDevelopment2017 shows that self-selection research design could significantly impact the effect size. For the studies with self-selection control, the estimated elasticity of population density becomes -0.22, which is much stronger than @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010 's result (-0.04). An advantage of meta-regression is that the two groups with/without self-selection control can share the common errors, fully utilize the information, and overcome the small sample size issue to a certain extent. The number of studies with self-selection control is four, while the total selected studies are 19. This result is more reliable than the average value in the self-selection control group.

Another improvement is that Stevens' meta-regression uses the weighted least squares (WLS) method. The weights are the precision (inverse of variance) of each observation. The same weights are applied on the weighted average and precision-effect estimate with standard error (PEESE) method in his 'Technical Appendix for details.' The estimated elasticities of population density with the three methods are -0.22, -0.13, and -0.20, respectively. Unfortunately, Stevens doesn't share his data of standard error of coefficients in the article and technical appendix. It is not easy to check his data and results.

Note that one observation, the study by @chatmanHowDensityMixed2003, may dramatically twist Stevens' result about density. In Chatman's Tobit model, the average VMT is $\bar y= 3.988$; the average household density is $\bar x= 1.902$ (housing units per square mile, residential block group (1,000s)); the coefficient of household density is $\beta=-0.082$. Then the elasticity should be

$$
\beta\cdot\frac{\bar x}{\bar y}=-0.082\cdot\frac{1.902}{3.988}=-0.0391
$$

This elasticity calculated by @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010 is -0.58. And it is not selected in the meta-analysis because the response is VMT on commercial trips. @stevensDoesCompactDevelopment2017 chooses this study and calculates a different elasticity -0.34. Whatever, -0.34 is the smallest elasticity, and the second smallest one [@zahabiSpatiotemporalAnalysisCar2015] is -0.22. At the same time, the rest studies give the range of elasticities from 0 to -0.20. Hence, these observations are highly skewed.

@chatmanHowDensityMixed2003 's model is also the only one of four studies with self-selection control. When this case is removed (-0.34), the estimated effect size will be much close to zero. @zahabiSpatiotemporalAnalysisCar2015 has the largest sample size (147574). Steven finds the PEESE method for bias correction will change the weighted average elasticity from -0.13 to -0.20. He hesitates to remove this 'outlier' because the outcome will become -0.09. At last, he chooses to keep this observation and report the result without bias correction (-0.22). Changing the criteria after seeing the results is called post hoc analysis or exploratory analysis.

Stevens' work triggers a round of discussion. @ewingDoesCompactDevelopment2017 reply that they don't doubt Stevens' results and criticize his conclusions. They agree with the values of elasticity but argue that Stevens' results (-0.22 for density) are not small actually. They emphasize the extensive benefit of compacting development. They don't think reporting bias widely exists in travel-urban form studies. The different results of the meta-analysis are mainly due to the studies selection, such as the U.S. or international context. Keeping or removing the outlier is also makes the difference.

Other scholars also contribute various insights. @manvilleTravelBuiltEnvironment2017 supports the idea that compact development is related to less car use and looks at it as a "fundamental belief in urban planning." @nelsonCompactDevelopmentReduces2017 agree that selective reporting bias does exist when some "interests or ideology dominate the discussion." @cliftonGettingHereThere2017 points out some weaknesses and potential sources of bias in current travel behavior studies. @heresFutureResearchLink2017 support more application of meta-analysis on relevant studies. And they remind the substantial difference among the studies with varied methods, country data sources, and metrics (e.g., commuting and noncommuting trips). They suggest narrowing the scope of studies to get more specific conclusions for policymakers. @knaapDrivingCompactGrowth2017 provide suggestions for improving this approach from the perspective of sample size, model specification, and weighing. Among the discussion, a key issue is whether a universal effect of compact development concerning driving distance exists or the effect is context-dependent. Stevens' work should not be criticized for the cross-country scope if the former is true. If the latter is true, it still should be based on evidence rather than belief or experience. The complexity of urban issues makes it is an unsolved problem.

@handyThoughtsMeaningMark2017 agrees with the improvement by meta-regression but thinks that meta-analysis is not a direction worth further investigation. In a later paper, @handyEnoughAlreadyLet2018 argues that accessibility-centered studies should replace the 5Ds framework. \@stevensResponseCommentariesDoes2017 responses to commentaries and clarifies some research goals and important questions. He insists this meta-regression is currently the "most accurate synthesis of the literature."

Stevens' study shows an uncommon direction of bias on the elasticity of population density. A usual assumption of publication bias is small studies tend to have greater standard errors and effect sizes. In contrast, among the 19 studies including the density variable, the effect sizes in small studies are closer to zero. A possible reason is that the studies with high heterogeneity answer different questions. Researchers may not have too much pressure for small effect size in a highly heterogeneous field. Another possible explanation is that most recent studies include a bundle of predictors. Once one or more coefficients show significance, the paper will be treated equally. Publication bias only affects the nothing significant studies.

-   @astonExploringBuiltEnvironment2021

After the two milestones for meta-analysis of built environment and travel behavior, a recent update re-examines the post-2010 empirical literature. @astonStudyDesignImpacts2020 collected 146 studies containing 467 models recorded as 1662 data points. There are 15 predictors of research design, including the number of variables, aggregate/disaggregate data, general/commuter group, trip purposes, time periods, types of model, which are used to examine how research design affects the built environment-mode choice studies. Instead of using elasticities as the response variable, they choose correlation, another dimensionless variable to measure the strength of the relationship between the built environment and transit use. Their results show that whether accounting residential self-selection and regional accessibility can account for 40% of the variation of mode choice in the meta-regression.

This meta-regression uses the Stepwise selection method to remove the insignificant predictors. 40% is the coefficient of determination $R^2$ in the four-predictor model for density and the five-predictor model for diversity. In these meta-regression models, standard errors $SE_r$ show the largest coefficient value. Control for covariance (which lacks explanation in this paper) contributes to the second large one. Control for regional accessibility is an insignificant variable in both density and diversity models. How can we conclude that 40% of the variation is due to the control of self-selection and regional accessibility? @astonStudyDesignImpacts2020 mention the asymmetry in the funnel plot for density and accessibility. It is evidence of publication bias that could lead to overestimating the correlation. But the plot is not shown in the paper.

In a later paper, @astonExploringBuiltEnvironment2021 further improve the meta-analysis to examine the impacts of 5D variables on transit use. The number of studies is extended to 187. And 418 of 505 elasticities are used as a valid response. They find that using a random-effect model, the elasticity of density on transit use (0.10) is close to @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010 's result (0.07). The standard error of the estimate is also included $SE=0.013$. Using these estimates, they re-examine the effects of control for self-selection and regional accessibility. The paired tests show that both indicators significantly impact elasticities of density. They also find that the estimated elasticity of density in the studies after 2010 is significantly higher than before 2010. The authors explain this change by more diverse study locations and more studies that control regional accessibility after 2010.

## Spatial Scales {#scale}

### Modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)

Due to the various data sources or research interests, travel-urban form studies divide into two groups. One group uses aggregated travel and built-environment variables at the city, county, or metropolitan level. At the same time, the other group uses trip data at the individual or household level. The results of travel models at different scales are often inconsistent. Using the same data source, @ewingTestingNewmanKenworthy2018 found that the elasticity of VMT with respect to population density is -0.164 in the aggregate models, which is a much higher value than disaggregate studies (-0.04 in the meta-analysis of @ewingTravelBuiltEnvironment2010). They suspect that this phenomenon is aggregation bias or ecological fallacy. They further explain that the two scales represent two different questions: The metropolitan-level density, which strongly affects the VMT, is not equivalent to the neighborhood density, which has much weaker effects on VMT.

Early in 1930, scholars noticed that when a set of smaller areal units was aggregated into larger areal units, the variance structure would be changed, and the estimated coefficients would be larger [@gehlkeCertainEffectsGrouping1934]. This inconsistency/sensitivity of analysis results is called modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) or ecological fallacy [@openshawEcologicalFallaciesAnalysis1984]. In spatial analysis, two kinds of MAUP often happen simultaneously [@wongModifiableArealUnit2004]. The first one, called the 'scale effect,' means that the correlation among variables depends on the size of areal units. Larger units usually lead to more extensive estimations. The second one, 'zone effect,' describes the various correlation results by choosing different areal shapes or subsets at the same scale.

@fotheringhamModifiableArealUnit1991 found that multivariate analysis is unreliable when using the data from areal units. Both value and direction of estimated coefficients may change for different spatial configurations [@leeModifiableArealUnit2016; @xuModifiableArealUnit2018]. The factors measured at a specific scale could only explain the variation generated at or above that level. Some factors, such as density, have cross scales. Their distributions in different units and scales are not identical. It is reasonable for them to have various meanings and influences on travel. A systematic comparison should be conducted among multi-scale studies. The inconsistency might not be correct or wrong. As @ewingTestingNewmanKenworthy2018 commented, the aggregate and disaggregate studies ask the apples and oranges questions.

### Aggregated Analysis

Aggregate data is more accessible and convenient to combine with other data sources. Once a travel survey contains the attribute of [geographic identifiers](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html) defined by Census, travel information can be integrated into other demographic, employment, and built environment data (e.g., [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/census-acs.html)). The data can be further mapped to different levels using the uniform coding (Table \@ref(tab:geoid)). For example, @ewingTestingNewmanKenworthy2018 use the average per capita VMT of all urbanized areas across the U.S. from FHWA's Highway Statistics. Then they join the 2010 census data in 157 urbanized areas (with populations of two hundred thousand or more) to FHWA's VMT data.

Some aggregate studies show that using the simple averages of individual data, the estimations of coefficients in the linear model are unbiased [@praisGroupingObservationsRegression1954]. A condition is that the regression model must fix the *omission error* using proper specification [@amrheinSearchingElusiveAggregation1995; @yeImpactsModifiableAreal2021]. The check of unit consistency may help examine the biases by MAUP on the estimations.

The tradition of aggregate analysis treats a city or metropolitan as an observation. Both dependent and independent variables are aggregated at the macro level. The aggregate models confound the individual level's variance. Urban form factors usually show a significant effect. @vandecoeveringReevaluatingImpactUrban2006 carry on Newman and Kenworthy's work and consider four sets of potential explanatory variables: ten of urban form, six of transport service, five of housing and development history, and thirteen of socio-economic situations. They fit some linear regression models (all the variables keep the initial magnitude without taking logarithm or other transformation), and their adjusted $R^2$ is higher than 0.7. Their models also show that the cities with higher population density drive less. They found the land use characteristics of the inner area are more critical than metropolitan-wide population density.

In aggregate analysis, the urban form factors measure the overall magnitude, such as population density, and can not reflect the land-use pattern or structure. A recent city-level study [@gimAnalyzingCitylevelEffects2021] fits multiple regression models based on the data from 65 global cities. Their results show that using structural equation modeling, fuel price, household size, and congestion level strongly affect travel time. In their model, the effect of overall population density becomes insignificant, while in the high-density built-up areas, the population density still has a larger impact on travel.

### Disaggregated Analysis

For disaggregate studies, collecting complete personal travel records and the built environment information is difficult. A common way is to get travel survey data from the local transportation department and combine it with census data and GIS data. Some scholars start their relevant research from individual data, then make a bottom-up aggregation to traffic zones (TAZ) or higher levels. [@zhaoRethinkingDeterminantsVehicle2021]. In disaggregate analysis, the travel records by individual or household are the basic unit of dependent variables. TraTravelers'cio-demographic characteristics such as income, working status, and vehicle ownership also keep this resolution. However, built environment factors technically have a minimum geographic unit as the measured scope. Census Tract and Block Group are the most common unit in disaggregate analysis.

Scholars who choose disaggregate analysis believe that the internal difference of urban characteristics is neglected at the regional level. They are interested in the impact of meso-level built-environment factors like the population and employment distribution of intra-urban [@buchananEffectUrbanGrowth2006; @sultanaJourneytoWorkPatternsAge2007]. Some studies confirm that individual-level data make the travel-land use model more reliable [@boarnetInfluenceLandUse2001]. Using disaggregated data can disclose the neighborhood-level differences and eliminate aggregation bias. Using logarithms of VMTs per vehicle from *National Personal Travel Survey (NPTS)* data with 114 urban areas, @bentoEffectsUrbanSpatial2005 fit the linear model with 19 variables. Instead of population density, they found that population centrality significantly affects VMT. The elasticity of annual VMT with respect to population centrality is 1.5. [^form-2]

[^form-2]: "population centrality measure is computed by averaging the difference between the cumulative population in annulus n (expressed as a percentage of total population) and the cumulative distance-weighted population in annulus n (expressed as a percentage of total distance-weighted population)."

Aggregate and disaggregate are relative concepts. Literature usually treats the data at the household level as disaggregated, but it is aggregated by person or trip. From Census Block to Tract, County, and Metropolitan Area, the data at these levels are all called aggregated, but they have substantial differences. @schwanenImpactMetropolitanStructure2004 explains that many urban form dimensions are tied to specific geographical scales. Recently, more studies have imported the spatial scales as an explanatory variable. In a travel and polycentric development report, @ewingReducingVehicleMiles2020 identify 589 centers in 28 U.S. regions. Then a categorical variable, 'within/outside a center,' is added to the model. The results show that households living within a center have more walk trips and fewer VMT than those living outside. @leeComparingImpactsLocal2020 also conducted a study involving factors at three levels: household, Census Tract, Urbanized Area. They find that density and centrality affect VMT at the urban level and the meso-scmesoscaleousing mix. After controlling for factors, the effect of local factors at the urban-level spatial structure moderates the effect size of the local built environment on travel.
