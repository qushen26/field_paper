  abstract = {In the battle between the car and sustainable modes of transport, the car often wins. Private vehicle use is responsible for a range of environmental and health problems including climate change and air pollution. What motivates people to drive? What would motivate people to use sustainable modes of transport? This chapter provides an overview of (a selection of) environmental determinants and (a selection of) individual determinants of travel mode choice. Environmental determinants include characteristics of the built environment, such as density, street connectivity, and infrastructure. Individual determinants include variables from the theory of planned behaviour, personal norms and habits. In this chapter, I propose that more research is needed that integrates the role of environmental and individual factors to inform behaviour change interventions to reduce car use.},

  abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

The new evidence, however, both supports and conflicts with previous work. This paper represents the first stage in a series of numerical experiments designed to explore the nature and extent of scale and zonation effects. Results from a series of carefully controlled statistical simulations are reported. It is concluded that there definitely are aggregation effects separate from effects that can be attributed to changing the definition of the spatial process. These effects, however, vary with the statistic calculated. Means and variances are resistant to aggregation effects, whereas regression coefficients and correlation statistics exhibit dramatic effects. In summary, the world of spatial analysis as it relates to the modifiable areal unit problem is not entirely well-behaved, but neither is it completely random and ill-defined.},

  abstract = {The built environment (BE) is widely accepted to influence transit use (TU). Evidence to date suggests the relationship is dependent on many factors which can be difficult to account for in quantitative studies. This creates barriers to transferring research into practice. Considering many studies together can be useful for accounting for more of the factors impacting transit use. Yet, meta-analysis of research measuring these influences was last undertaken in 2010 based on 18 studies. Since then 90 new quantitative studies have been published. These recent studies use improved methodologies and are conducted in more diverse geographies. This paper reports an improved and updated meta-analysis of built environment impacts on transit use. It compares elasticity estimates from research published pre-and post-2010 and explores the impact of new methods and a more diverse geographical representation on findings. Updated meta-elasticities range from {$<$}0.01 to 0.26; a similar range to the 2010 study. However, at the individual indicator levels, more recent results are different. Elasticities for urban density, including population, employment and commercial density, have increased significantly in studies published since 2010, as did that of land use mix. However, measures of local access, design and jobs-housing balance decreased in post-2010 studies. These results confirm the small but imprecise relationship between the BE and TU. Results also suggest that while the range of elasticity impacts is relatively consistent, new study methodologies, notably those that control for regional accessibility and self-selection, and the increasing geographical diversity in study applications, is acting to change BE-TU findings at the indicator level. Research setting and context are important to consider when using empirical results to design BE strategies to promote transit use.},

  abstract = {The different factors examined in studies linking the built environment and transit use explain about half of the variability in findings for travel behavior. Despite many differences in the research design of these studies, it is not known if choices about study design impact theoretical consistency in results and account for some of the unexplained variance between studies. This gap exists because multiple studies must be analyzed together to explore the topic. This study aims to fill this gap, using a sample of data points and statistical models from 146 studies identified through a comprehensive database search. This paper first synthesizes the study design adopted in empirical studies of the built environment and transit use. Meta-regression is then used to identify study design aspects causing significant differences. Selective reporting bias appears to slightly exaggerate estimates for built environment Density and Accessibility. Over 40\% of variability in findings for Density and Diversity was explained by study design aspects. These include whether collinearity of variables is accounted for, the specificity of the sample population and transit mode, catchment size; and the number of explanatory variables specified. Overall the average correlations for built environment and transit use are weak ({$<$}0.2). Predictions of transit ridership based on built environment factors are likely to be imprecise, so models should be carefully specified. Given the impact of study design, adherence to best practice conventions could reduce variance within studies and dispersion between studies. For ambiguous specification issues, sensitivity testing could be used to generate prediction intervals. Further investigation of factors such as transit mode and catchment size would be useful to determine if there is a theoretically plausible reason to favor certain specifications.},

In this survey, we review the approaches developed to reproduce various mobility patterns, with the main focus on recent developments. This review can be used both as an introduction to the fundamental modeling principles of human mobility, and as a collection of technical methods applicable to specific mobility-related problems. The review organizes the subject by differentiating between individual and population mobility and also between short-range and long-range mobility.

The methods of discrete choice analysis and their applications in the modelling of transportation systems constitute a comparatively new field that has largely evolved over the past 15 years.

For this, we have identified through our literature review 67 potential variables categorised into two groups; the built environment and the households’ socio-economic characteristics. We have considered the city of Djelfa as a case study and used the questionnaire as a data collection tool. The questionnaire processing of the 700 questionnaires provided to the households allowed us to select 184 questionnaires for our analysis. The sensitivity analysis protocol is designed for two stages; (i) an exploratory stage, conducted by principal component analysis and bivariate correlation analysis; (ii) and a confirmatory stage conducted by a path analysis. The first step allowed us to hypothesise several causal pathways that could explain, directly or indirectly, the modal share of commuting. The results of the path analysis show that the modal shares of walking, private car and public transit are controlled by 13, 16 and 12 explanatory variables, respectively. Overall, the socio-economic characteristics of households discourage walking and transit use, and encourage private car commuting. On the other hand, the variables identified in this paper related to the built environment discourage walking, but encourage the},

  abstract = {The dominant approach in the literature to dealing with sample selection is to assume a bivariate normality assumption directly on the error terms, or on transformed error terms, in the discrete and continuous equations. Such an assumption can be restrictive and inappropriate, since the implication is a linear and symmetrical dependency structure between the error terms. In this paper, we introduce and apply a flexible approach to sample selection in the context of built environment effects on travel behavior. The approach is based on the concept of a “copula”, which is a multivariate functional form for the joint distribution of random variables derived purely from pre-specified parametric marginal distributions of each random variable. The copula concept has been recognized in the statistics field for several decades now, but it is only recently that it has been explicitly recognized and employed in the econometrics field. The copula-based approach retains a parametric specification for the bivariate dependency, but allows testing of several parametric structures to characterize the dependency. The empirical context in the current paper is a model of residential neighborhood choice and daily household vehicle miles of travel (VMT), using the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area Household Travel Survey (BATS). The sample selection hypothesis is that households select their residence locations based on their travel needs, which implies that observed VMT differences between households residing in neo-urbanist and conventional neighborhoods cannot be attributed entirely to the built environment variations between the two neighborhoods types. The results indicate that, in the empirical context of the current study, the VMT differences between households in different neighborhood types may be attributed to both built environment effects and residential self-selection effects. As importantly, the study indicates that use of a traditional Gaussian bivariate distribution to characterize the relationship in errors between residential choice and VMT can lead to misleading implications about built environment effects.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a model for the conditional inflated multivariate density of integer count variables with domain ℤn, n ∈ ℕ. Our modelling framework is based on a copula approach and can be used for a broad set of applications where the primary characteristics of the data are: (i) discrete domain; (ii) the tendency to cluster at certain outcome values; and (iii) contemporaneous dependence. These kinds of properties can be found for high- or ultra-high-frequency data describing the trading process on financial markets. We present a straightforward sampling method for such an inflated multivariate density through the application of an independence Metropolis–Hastings sampling algorithm. We demonstrate the power of our approach by modelling the conditional bivariate density of bid and ask quote changes in a high-frequency setup. We show how to derive the implied conditional discrete density of the bid–ask spread, taking quote clusterings (at multiples of 5 ticks) into account. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

First, this relationship is extremely complex. Second, several specification and estimation issues are poorly addressed in prior work, possibly generating biased results. We argue that many of the latter problems are overcome by systematically isolating the separable influences of urban design characteristics on travel and then properly analyzing individual-level data. We further clarify which results directly follow from alternative land use arrangements and which may or may not, and thus identify the specific hypotheses to be tested against the data. We then develop more-reliable tests of these hypotheses, and explore the implications of alternative behavioral assumptions regarding travel costs. The measured influence of land use on travel behavior is shown to be very sensitive to the form of the empirical strategy.},

Analysis of the trajectories of over half a million dollar bills shows that human dispersal is described by a ‘two-parameter continuous-time random walk’ model: our travel habits conform to a type of random proliferation known as ‘superdiffusion’. And with that much established, it should soon be possible to develop a new class of models to account for the spread of human disease.},

In light of this, the relationship between urban form and transport was investigated in Christchurch through the analysis of journey to work data from 1991 and 2001. Low density suburban areas were found to generate and receive the highest percentages of car trips in both 1991 and 2001. It was also found that the majority of work-trips involved suburb-to-suburb commuting, rather than to the centre of the city. Average trip length did not increase substantially over this period, although increases were apparent in separate modes. Multivariate regression analysis established that the key variable determining modal split and trip length was the distance the residence was located from the central business district. Results were similar when compared to larger cities elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Twenty years ago, behavioral economics did not exist as a field. Most economists were deeply skeptical--even antagonistic--toward the idea of importing insights from psychology into their field. Today, behavioral economics has become virtually mainstream. It is well represented in prominent journals and top economics departments, and behavioral economists, including several contributors to this volume, have garnered some of the most prestigious awards in the profession. This book assembles the most important papers on behavioral economics published since around 1990. Among the 25 articles are many that update and extend earlier foundational contributions, as well as cutting-edge papers that break new theoretical and empirical ground. Advances in Behavioral Economics will serve as the definitive one-volume resource for those who want to familiarize themselves with the new field or keep up-to-date with the latest developments. It will not only be a core text for students, but will be consulted widely by professional economists, as well as psychologists and social scientists with an interest in how behavioral insights are being applied in economics.

What is less well understood is the extent to which the observed patterns of travel behaviour can be attributed to the residential built environment (BE) itself, as opposed to attitude‐induced residential self‐selection. To date, most studies addressing this self‐selection issue fall into nine methodological categories: direct questioning, statistical control, instrumental variables, sample selection, propensity score, joint discrete choice models, structural equations models, mutually dependent discrete choice models and longitudinal designs. This paper reviews 38 empirical studies using these approaches. Virtually all of the studies reviewed found a statistically significant influence of the BE remaining after self‐selection was accounted for. However, the practical importance of that influence was seldom assessed. Although time and resource limitations are recognized, we recommend usage of longitudinal structural equations modelling with control groups, a design which is strong with respect to all causality requisites.},

Methodologists have proposed a variety of statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is not clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here, we present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of the most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might realistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several levels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature. Our results clearly indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently outperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses—that is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might change depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the primary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications.

  abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions —density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the ‘3Ds’ affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing ‘walking quality’ was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

Investigating this question is an important addition to the current research, which has focused on residential neighborhoods. Data from the 1995 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey are used to investigate the influence of workplace employment density and share of retail employment on commute mode choice and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) to access personal commercial activities. The analysis controls for socioeconomic characteristics and accounts for the endogeneity of commute mode choice and personal commercial VMT by employing a joint logit-Tobit model. Employment density at the workplace is found to be associated with a lower likelihood of automobile commuting and reduced personal commercial VMT, while the presence of employment in the retail category does not play a significant role. Workplace density is more clearly related to reduced VMT and automobile commuting than to characteristics of workers’ residential neighborhoods and could have significant influences on personal commercial VMT and automobile commuting when increasing over a large area. The results suggest that land use planners should focus on encouraging employment density to a greater extent than is the current practice, although further research is needed on the role played by correlated factors such as higher parking costs, increased road congestion, and better transit service.},

The solution to a scaling relation equation is always a power law. The scaling laws are followed by many natural and social phenomena such as cities, earthquakes, and rivers. This paper reveals the power law behaviors in systems of natural cities by reconstructing the urban hierarchy with cascade structure. Cities of the U.S.A., Britain, France, and Germany are taken as examples to perform empirical analyses. The hierarchical scaling relations can be well fitted to the data points within the scaling ranges of the number, size and area of the natural cities. The size-number and area-number scaling exponents are close to 1, and the size-area allometric scaling exponent is slightly less than 1. The results show that natural cities follow hierarchical scaling laws very well. The principle of entropy maximization of urban evolution is then employed to explain the hierarchical scaling laws, and differences entropy maximizing processes are used to interpret the scaling exponents. This study is helpful for scientists to understand the power law behavior in the development of cities and systems of cities.},

In this article, we look at the problem from a location-centric perspective: We investigate methods to extract, classify, and quantify the symbolic locations specified in telco trajectories and use such measures to feature user mobility. A major contribution is a novel trajectory summarization technique for the extraction of the locations of interest, i.e., attractive, from symbolic trajectories. The method is built on a density-based trajectory segmentation technique tailored to telco data, which is proven to be robust against noise. To inspect the nature of those locations, we combine the two dimensions of location attractiveness and frequency into a novel location taxonomy, which allows for a more accurate classification of the visited places. Another major contribution is the selection of suitable entropy-based metrics for the characterization of single trajectories, based on the diversity of the locations of interest. All these components are integrated in a framework utilized for the analysis of 100,000+ telco trajectories. The experiments show how the framework manages to dramatically reduce data complexity, provide high-quality information on the mobility behavior of people, and finally succeed in grasping the nature of the locations visited by individuals.},

However, the built environment also influences elements such as travel distance and car ownership, which might be the true predictors of which travel modes are chosen. In this study, we analyse the effects of changes in residential neighbourhood on changes in travel mode (for commute trips and leisure trips), both directly and indirectly through changes in car ownership, travel distances and travel attitudes. This study applies a structural equation modelling approach using quasi-longitudinal data from 1650 recently relocated residents in the city of Ghent, Belgium. Results indicate that the built environment has strong direct effects on active leisure trips and car use. However, distance (for car use) and attitudes (for active travel) were found to be important mediating variables. In sum, the effect of the built environment on travel mode choice might be more complex than commonly assumed as it partly seems mediated by travel distance and travel attitudes.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Planners need a clear understanding of what influences walking and bicycling behavior to develop effective strategies to increase use of those modes. Transportation practitioners have largely focused on infrastructure and the built environment, although researchers have found that attitudes are also very important. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) suggests that behavior such as active transportation results from a mixture of personal attitudes toward these modes, subjective norms, and a person's perceived behavioral control, giving us a way to conceptualize psychological factors that influence travel behavior. Using data from a random phone survey of three neighborhoods in Portland (OR), we test whether TPB explains the possible causal relationships among the built environment, socio-demographics, and active transportation. We find that both the built environment and demographics influence cycling and walking, although indirectly, by influencing attitudes and perceived behavioral control. Moreover, it is important to look at bicycle-specific infrastructure separately from other environmental characteristics. For example, relatively flat neighborhoods with well-connected, low-traffic streets and multiple destinations were associated with more frequent bicycling, but striped bike lanes were not.Takeaway for practice: Practitioners cannot rely solely on changing the environment to increase bicycling. Programs such as public events and individualized marketing that influence attitudes may be necessary to reinforce positive environmental features. This is particularly true for women and older adults. Moreover, adding bike lanes to an otherwise poor bicycling environment may not increase bicycling in any significant way.},

We found that they have a stronger effect on weekdays than on weekends. On weekdays, their collective influence is larger than that of demographics. Furthermore, they show salient non-linear effects on driving distance in both models, challenging the linearity assumption commonly adopted in the literature. This study also identifies effective ranges of distance to different centers and population density, and highlights the important role of sub-centers in driving reduction.},

To fill this gap, in this study the relationships among travel mode choice, car ownership and travel distance were described using a framework of integrated structural equation model (SEM) and discrete choice model (DCM). Drawing on a rich dataset of National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and numerous built environment measurements in Baltimore metropolitan area, this research applied the integrated SEM and DCM approach to investigate how the built environment affects travel mode choice through influencing car ownership and travel distance. Therefore, the direct and indirect effects of built environment on travel mode choice were revealed.

Studies on the relationship between land use and travel behavior are often at a certain aggregated spatial unit such as traffic analysis zone (TAZ), spatial issues occur among individuals clustered within a zone because of the locational effects. However, recognition of the spatial issues in travel modeling was not sufficiently investigated yet. The object of this study is twofold. First, a multilevel hazard model was applied to accommodate the spatial context in which individuals generate commuting distance. Second, this research provides additional insights into examine the effects of socio-demographics and built environment on commuting distance. Using Washington metropolitan area as the case, the built environment measures were calculated for each TAZ. To estimate the model parameters, the robust maximum likelihood estimation method for a partial function was used, and the model results confirmed the important roles that played by the TAZ and individual level factors in influencing commuting distance. Meanwhile, a comparison among the general multilevel model, single level and multilevel hazard models was conducted. The results suggest that application of the multilevel hazard-based model obtains significant improvements over traditional model. The significant spatial heterogeneity parameter indicates that it is necessary to accommodate the spatial issues in the context of commuting distance. The results are expected to give urban planners a better understanding on how the TAZ and individual level factors influence the commuting distance, and consequently develop targeted countermeasures.},

This study develops a semi-parametric multilevel mixed logit model to identify non-linear and spatially heterogeneous relationships between built environment attributes and transit commuting in Nanjing, China. The results show that built environment variables in residential areas have saliently non-linear associations with transit commuting, and the associations vary across traffic analysis zones. Densification facilitates transit use but it has a diminishing return. A medium level of mixed-use is conducive to transit commuting. Transit supply has to exceed a certain threshold to be effective. These findings offer nuanced guidance for transit-oriented neighborhood planning.},

A local scale approach highlights efficient settlements in terms of transport energy consumption not only within major towns, but also within remote rural areas. Furthermore, results suggest that influencing the urban form following local energy efficient examples rather than regional ones could also yield significant gains, without an extreme policy stance of re-urbanisation in major cities.},

We find that density alone explains only a small fraction of the variation in vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and many confounders account for the differences in automobile dependence. We also find that it is not the localized density of individual neighborhoods that causes VMT to be lower in compact urbanized areas but rather the relative accessibility of neighborhoods to the rest of the region.},

  abstract = {The potential to moderate travel demand through changes in the built environment is the subject of more than 50 recent empirical studies. The majority of recent studies are summarized. Elasticities of travel demand with respect to density, diversity, design, and regional accessibility are then derived from selected studies. These elasticity values may be useful in travel forecasting and sketch planning and have already been incorporated into one sketch planning tool, the Environmental Protection Agency\{\textbackslash textquoteright\}s Smart Growth Index model. In weighing the evidence, what can be said, with a degree of certainty, about the effects of built environments on key transportation \{\textbackslash textquotedblleft\}outcome\{\textbackslash textquotedblright\} variables: trip frequency, trip length, mode choice, and composite measures of travel demand, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle hours traveled (VHT)? Trip frequencies have attracted considerable academic interest of late. They appear to be primarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics of travelers and secondarily a function of the built environment. Trip lengths have received relatively little attention, which may account for the various degrees of importance attributed to the built environment in recent studies. Trip lengths are primarily a function of the built environment and secondarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics. Mode choices have received the most intensive study over the decades. Mode choices depend on both the built environment and socioeconomics (although they probably depend more on the latter). Studies of overall VMT or VHT find the built environment to be much more significant, a product of the differential trip lengths that factor into calculations of VMT and VHT.},

  abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

In this study, we first update the original county index to 2010, then develop a refined index that accounts for more relevant factors, and finally seek to test the relationship between sprawl and traffic crash rates using structural equation modelling. Controlling for covariates, we find that sprawl is associated with significantly higher direct and indirect effects on fatal crash rates. The direct effect is likely due to the higher traffic speeds in sprawling areas, and the indirect effect is due to greater vehicle miles driven in such areas. Conversely, sprawl has negative direct relationships with total crashes and non-fatal injury crashes, and these offset (and sometimes overwhelm) the positive indirect effects of sprawl on both types of crashes through the mediating effect of increased vehicle miles driven. The most likely explanation is the greater prevalence of fender benders and other minor accidents in the low speed, high conflict traffic environments of compact areas, negating the lower vehicle miles travelled per capita in such areas.},

It employs multilevel modelling to account for the dependence of households in the same region on shared regional characteristics and estimates ‘hurdle’ models to account for the excess number of zero values in the distributions of dependent variables such as household transit trips. It tests built environment variables for three different buffer widths around household locations to see which scale best explains travel behaviour.

In an investigation of the parameter estimates from a multiple linear regression model and a multiple logit regression model, conclusions are drawn about the sensitivity of such estimates to variations in scale and zoning systems. The modifiable areal unit problem is shown to be essentially unpredictable in its intensity and effects in multivariate statistical analysis and is therefore a much greater problem than in univariate or bivariate analysis. The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units. Given that such analyses can only be expected to increase with the imminent availability of new census data both in the United Kingdom and in the USA, and the current proliferation of GIS (geographical information system) technology which permits even more access to aggregated data, this paper serves as a topical warning.},

Americans are increasingly sedentary; erstwhile the rate of increase in obesity is alarming. New research suggests that increased auto dependence, and limited opportunities to walk for utilitarian purposes, has contributed to this emerging obesity epidemic. Within sociodemographic strata, land use patterns and transportation investments collectively shape the desire to walk, drive, or to travel via other means. Mixed use and more compact community designs show significant promise for the promotion of physical activity and the reduction of regional air pollution levels. Opportunities exist to increase physical activity and improve regional air quality through more compact development. However, increased compactness, or density, often exacerbates traffic congestion and can increase exposure of harmful emissions within central areas. Therefore, strategies to reduce localized air pollution in existing and developing centers are required to enable larger health benefits from smart growth to be realized.},

The land use–travel time–carbon emission relationship in which the time is specified as a mediator is analyzed at the city level on an international scale based on individually reported data by moving away from the tendency of conducting country-level, regional-scale analysis based on estimates from travel survey data or satellite images. A major finding of the structural equation model is that because of the high population density in their high-density built-up areas, compact developments with urban cores reduce travel, and indirectly lessen CO2 emissions (complete mediation by travel time). In contrast, despite no effect on travel, gross population density in the entire city is found to have a direct effect in reducing per-capita emissions based partially on the economies of scale. The proportion of the low-density built-up area in the city also directly reduces the emissions, which might reinforce the concept of the paradox of intensification. Among the control variables, household size, fuel price, and congestion level may ultimately lead to less CO2 emissions because their direct effects, which are positive on travel time, would be overwhelmed by the negative effects on CO2 emissions.},

Each model specifies: (1) residential self-selection as a sociodemographic or attitudinal confounding factor in the land use–travel behavior relationship; and (2) spatial multicollinearity as a land use confounding variable. The first model shows that the land use factor is related to travel behavior more strongly than is residential self-selection. The second model finds that, among land use variables, accessibility to regional centers is most strongly related to travel behavior. Depending on the accessibility–travel behavior relationship, other land use variables are conditionally related to travel behavior. This finding implies that accessibility represents the overall effect of land use on travel behavior.},

However, in previous studies the statistics of urban indicators were not analyzed in detail, raising important questions about the full characterization of urban properties and how scaling relations may emerge in these larger contexts. Here, we build a self-consistent statistical framework that characterizes the joint probability distributions of urban indicators and city population sizes across an urban system. To develop this framework empirically we use one of the most granular and stochastic urban indicators available, specifically measuring homicides in cities of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, three nations with high and fast changing rates of violent crime. We use these data to derive the conditional probability of the number of homicides per year given the population size of a city. To do this we use Bayes’ rule together with the estimated conditional probability of city size given their number of homicides and the distribution of total homicides. We then show that scaling laws emerge as expectation values of these conditional statistics. Knowledge of these distributions implies, in turn, a relationship between scaling and population size distribution exponents that can be used to predict Zipf’s exponent from urban indicator statistics. Our results also suggest how a general statistical theory of urban indicators may be constructed from the stochastic dynamics of social interaction processes in cities.},

For that purpose we estimate a general three-parameter Zipf model, which can be traced back to Mandelbrot (1982), and validate our results by means of the hierarchical scaling law. Especially in the second half of the twentieth century, we find a pronounced departure from the exact Zipf's law. The city size distribution has become more equally distributed over time. Besides, the applied estimation method reveals evidence for leading cities dominating the remaining largest cities. Thus, the growing equality of the city sizes can be explained rather by growing smaller cities than by a loss of importance of the largest ones.},

  abstract = {The debate over metropolitan sprawl and its costs has been ongoing since the early 1970s in the U.S. To inform the debate, this study uses principal component analysis (PCA) and 2010 cross sectional data for large U.S. urbanized areas (UZAs) to operationalize compactness/sprawl in each of four dimensions—development density, land use mix, activity centering, and street accessibility. Higher values represent greater compactness, lower values greater sprawl. The four factors are then combined into an overall compactness/sprawl index. The study then applies factor score coefficient values for 2010 to the same variables for 2000 to create comparable metrics for 2000. Compactness scores for 2000 are compared to the same scores for 2010 to see which UZAs sprawled the most between censuses, and which sprawled the least or actually became more compact. Finally, the study validates the compactness index and its component factors against transportation outcomes for 2010, specifically walk mode share, transit mode share, and average drive time on the journey to work. If sprawl has any widely accepted outcome, it is automobile dependence and heavy automobile use. Consistent with this characterization of sprawl, this study finds that the overall compactness index bears a strong relationship to transportation outcomes. Generalizing across the entire universe of large urbanized areas in the U.S., compactness decreased and sprawl increased between the two census years; but only slightly. Several urbanized areas, however, have significantly different rankings in 2000 than 2010.},

  abstract = {The sprawling patterns of land development common to metropolitan areas of the US have been blamed for high levels of automobile travel, and thus for air quality problems. In response, smart growth programs—designed to counter sprawl—have gained popularity in the US. Studies show that, all else equal, residents of neighborhoods with higher levels of density, land-use mix, transit accessibility, and pedestrian friendliness drive less than residents of neighborhoods with lower levels of these characteristics. These studies have shed little light, however, on the underlying direction of causality—in particular, whether neighborhood design influences travel behavior or whether travel preferences influence the choice of neighborhood. The evidence thus leaves a key question largely unanswered: if cities use land use policies to bring residents closer to destinations and provide viable alternatives to driving, will people drive less and thereby reduce emissions? Here a quasi-longitudinal design is used to investigate the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and travel behavior while taking into account the role of travel preferences and neighborhood preferences in explaining this relationship. A multivariate analysis of cross-sectional data shows that differences in travel behavior between suburban and traditional neighborhoods are largely explained by attitudes. However, a quasi-longitudinal analysis of changes in travel behavior and changes in the built environment shows significant associations, even when attitudes have been accounted for, providing support for a causal relationship.},

  abstract = {Much of the literature shows that a compact city with well-mixed land use tends to produce lower vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and consequently lower energy consumption and less emissions. However, a significant portion of the literature indicates that the built environment only generates some minor—if any—influence on travel behavior. Through the literature review, we identify four major methodological problems that may have resulted in these conflicting conclusions: self-selection, spatial autocorrelation, inter-trip dependency, and geographic scale. Various approaches have been developed to resolve each of these issues separately, but few efforts have been made to reexamine the built environment-travel behavior relationship by considering these methodological issues simultaneously. The objective of this paper is twofold: (1) to better understand the existing methodological gaps, and (2) to reexamine the effects of built-environment factors on transportation by employing a framework that incorporates recently developed methodological approaches. Using the Seattle metropolitan region as our study area, the 2006 Household Activity Survey and the 2005 parcel and building data are used in our analysis. The research employs Bayesian hierarchical models with built-environment factors measured at different geographic scales. Spatial random effects based on a conditional autoregressive specification are incorporated in the hierarchical model framework to account for spatial contiguity among Traffic Analysis Zones. Our findings indicate that land use factors have highly significant effects on VMT even after controlling for travel attitude and spatial autocorrelation. In addition, our analyses suggest that some of these effects may translate into different empirical results depending on geographic scales and tour types.},

It should be checked if there are overdispersion and excess zero responses in count data to forecast the generation of trips. The forecasted values should also be non-negative ones. The study applies to nonhome based trips at household level to perform efficient analysis on count data. The Poisson model with an assumption of equidispersion has frequently been used to analyze count data. However, if the variance of data is greater than the mean, the Poisson model tends to underestimate errors, resulting in problem in reliability. Excess zeros in data result in heterogeneity leading to biased coefficient estimates for the models. The negative binomial model and the modified count data models are established to consider overdispersion and heterogeneity to improve the reliability. The optimal model is chosen through Vuong test. Model reliability is also checked by likelihood test and accuracy of estimated value of model by Theil inequality coefficient. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to know the change of nonhome based trips depending on the change in socio-economic characteristics.},

Ridge and surrogate solutions are compared on several marques of orthogonality to include conditioning of dispersion arrays, variance inflation factors, isotropy of variances, and sphericity of contours of the estimators. For these, ridge typically exhibits erratic divergence from orthogonality as the ridge scalar evolves, often reverting back to OLS in the limit. In contrast, surrogate solutions converge monotonically to those from orthogonal systems. Invariance considerations constrain the computations to models in canonical form.

  abstract = {Geospatial analysis is very much dominated by a Gaussian way of thinking, which assumes that things in the world can be characterized by a well-defined mean, i.e., things are more or less similar in size. However, this assumption is not always valid. In fact, many things in the world lack a well-defined mean, and therefore there are far more small things than large ones. This paper attempts to argue that geospatial analysis requires a different way of thinking – a Paretian way of thinking that underlies skewed distribution such as power laws, Pareto and lognormal distributions. I review two properties of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, and point out that the notion of spatial heterogeneity in current spatial statistics is only used to characterize local variance of spatial dependence or regression. I subsequently argue for a broad perspective on spatial heterogeneity, and suggest it be formulated as a scaling law. I further discuss the implications of Paretian thinking and the scaling law for better understanding geographic forms and processes, in particular while facing massive amounts of social media data. In the spirit of Paretian thinking, geospatial analysis should seek to simulate geographic events and phenomena from the bottom up rather than correlations as guided by Gaussian thinking.},

  abstract = {This article provides a new geospatial perspective on whether or not Zipf's law holds for all cities or for the largest cities in the United States using a massive dataset and its computing. A major problem around this issue is how to define cities or city boundaries. Most of the investigations of Zipf's law rely on the demarcations of cities imposed by census data, for example, metropolitan areas and census-designated places. These demarcations or definitions (of cities) are criticized for being subjective or even arbitrary. Alternative solutions to defining cities are suggested, but they still rely on census data for their definitions. In this article we demarcate urban agglomerations by clustering street nodes (including intersections and ends), forming what we call natural cities. Based on the demarcation, we found that Zipf's law holds remarkably well for all the natural cities (over 2–4 million in total) across the United States. There is little sensitivity for the holding with respect to the clustering resolution used for demarcating the natural cities. This is a big contrast to urban areas, as defined in the census data, which do not hold stable for Zipf's law.},

This paper does not deal with the latter issue with respect to why, and instead investigates whether Zipf’s law holds in a global setting, thus involving all cities around the world. Unlike previous studies, which have mainly relied on conventional census data such as populations and census-bureau-imposed definitions of cities, we adopt naturally (in terms of data speak for itself) delineated cities, or natural cities, to be more precise, in order to examine Zipf’s law. We find that Zipf’s law holds remarkably well for all natural cities at the global level, and it remains almost valid at the continental level except for Africa at certain time instants. We further examine the law at the country level, and note that Zipf’s law is violated from country to country or from time to time. This violation is mainly due to our limitations; we are limited to individual countries, or to a static view on city-size distributions. The central argument of this paper is that Zipf’s law is universal, and we therefore must use the correct scope in order to observe it. We further find Zipf’s law applied to city numbers; the number of cities in the largest country is twice as many as that in the second largest country, three times as many as that in the third largest country, and so on. These findings have profound implications for big data and the science of cities.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses seven metropolitan regions that are all experiencing rapid motorisation and are perhaps appearing to capitulate to the automobile. Through 20 years of changes, evidenced in systematic data from the mid-1990s, a different perspective is found. None of the urban regions appear near to or even capable of becoming automobile cities. Physical limits are already being reached that make higher levels of private motorised mobility very problematic if transport systems are to remain functional and the cities livable. These limits appear already to be reversing the decline in non-motorised modes and creating an upturn in transit systems, especially urban rail. That these cities have been able to either hold their own, or somewhat increase their share of total motorised mobility by transit over a 20-year period, is some indication that they are ‘hitting mobility walls’ much sooner in the motorisation path than cities in North America and Australia, which grew up with and were designed around the spatial needs of cars. Like many cities in the developed world that have shown a decoupling of car use and total passenger mobility from GDP growth from 1995 to 2005, there is now evidence that this is happening in less wealthy cities. This is important because it assists global and local goals for reduced CO2 from passenger transport, while allowing for economic progress. Such evidence suggests that automobile dependence is not an irresistible force in emerging economies.},

  abstract = {Automobile dependence, expressed through comparative levels of car ownership and use and transit service and use, varies widely and systematically across a large sample of international cities. US cities exhibit the most extreme dependence on the automobile, followed by Australian and Canadian cities, with European and Asian cities having very much more transit-oriented cities with greater levels of walking and cycling. These patterns are not strongly related to differences in wealth between cities, but do vary in a clear and systematic way with land use patterns. The total fixed and variable cost of cars per kilometre is also significantly related to the degree of automobile dependence in cities, though not as strongly as land use. The data suggest that the most auto-dependent cities are less wealthy than some other more transit-oriented cities. They have the worst operating cost recovery in transit, have far higher road construction and maintenance costs, spend the highest proportion of their wealth on passenger transportation but have roughly similar journey-to-work trip times and much longer trip lengths. These patterns suggest some important policy implications which stress the need to strategically reshape urban land use, to emphasise investment in non-auto infrastructure and to ensure that any physical planning strategies aimed at reducing automobile dependence work in concert with economic policies directed at increasing the real cost of both car ownership and car use.},

We estimate a simultaneous equations system to account for the potential residential self-selection problem. While most previous studies focus on a specific region, this paper uses national samples from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey. The estimation results indicate that residential density has a statistically significant but economically modest influence on vehicle usage, which is similar to that in previous studies. However, the joint effect of the contextual density measure (density in the context of its surrounding area) and residential density on vehicle usage is quantitatively larger than the sole effect of residential density. Moving a household from a suburban to an urban area reduces household annual mileage by 18\%. We also find that a lower neighborhood residential density induces consumer choices toward less fuel-efficient vehicles, which confirms the finding in Brownstone and Golob (2009).},

First, the average journey times for different modes of transport are inversely proportional to the energy consumption rates measured for the respective human physical activities. Second, when daily travel-time distributions for different modes of transport such as walking, cycling, bus or car travel are appropriately scaled, they turn out to have a universal functional relationship. This corresponds to a canonical-like energy distribution with exceptions for short trips, which can be theoretically explained. Combined, this points to a law of constant average energy consumption for the physical activity of daily travel. Applying these natural laws could help to improve long-term urban and transport planning.},

  abstract = {Numerous theoretical frameworks have been developed to explain the gap between the possession of environmental knowledge and environmental awareness, and displaying pro-environmental behavior. Although many hundreds of studies have been undertaken, no definitive explanation has yet been found. Our article describes a few of the most influential and commonly used analytical frameworks: early US linear progression models; altruism, empathy and prosocial behavior models; and finally, sociological models. All of the models we discuss (and many of the ones we do not such as economic models, psychological models that look at behavior in general, social marketing models and that have become known as deliberative and inclusionary processes or procedures (DIPS)) have some validity in certain circumstances. This indicates that the question of what shapes pro-environmental behavior is such a complex one that it cannot be visualized through one single framework or diagram. We then analyze the factors that have been found to have some influence, positive or negative, on pro-environmental behavior such as demographic factors, external factors (e.g. institutional, economic, social and cultural) and internal factors (e.g. motivation, pro-environmental knowledge, awareness, values, attitudes, emotion, locus of control, responsibilities and priorities). Although we point out that developing a model that tries to incorporate all factors might neither be feasible nor useful, we feel that it can help illuminate this complex field. Accordingly, we propose our own model based on the work of Fliegenschnee and Schelakovsky (1998) who were influenced by Fietkau and Kessel (1981).},

The second study, initiated within the Open University's Design Innovation Group, identifies key ‘hotspot’ factors that influence consumers' adoption of low carbon products.

Since private mobility is responsible for the greatest share of polluting emissions, it is necessary to gain deeper understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the choice of individuals to use either cars or alternative, environment-friendly transport modes. A meta-analysis on 58 primary studies is conducted to synthesize evidence on the determinants of travel mode choice, as regards both behavioral intentions and actual behaviors. Results suggest that, besides intentions, habits and past use represent the most relevant predictor, followed by constructs referring to the Theory of Planned Behavior framework. Environmental variables, on the other hand, play a relevant role in shaping behavioral intentions while their effect on actual behaviors is negligible, so that a deep intention behavior gap emerges. A moderator analysis is performed to explain the high heterogeneity in the results. Behaviors’ operationalization and measurement emerges as the moderator affecting heterogeneity of outcomes the most; trip purpose, sample type and year of the study also show a moderate effect on heterogeneity, while location does not appear to be a relevant moderator.},

  abstract = {The transportation sector accounts for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. Previous research suggests that major life events may be “windows of opportunity” for travel behaviour change. Our scoping review examined the effects of seven events (transitions to secondary school, post-secondary studies, labour market, marriage, parenthood, retirement, and relocation) on travel behaviours. Five databases were searched (MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, SportDISCUS, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) and 80 articles met inclusion criteria. Relocation was the most commonly examined event (with 51 studies). Findings illustrate that moving to compact neighbourhoods (with shorter commute distance/travel time, greater walkability/access to destinations) was associated with shifts towards sustainable travel modes (e.g., walking, cycling, and transit). Relocation might be particularly conducive to implementing scalable sustainable transportation interventions, as all six interventions with appropriate statistical power were effective. Entry into the labour market was generally associated with increased car use and declines in sustainable transportation. Qualitative studies suggested that attitudes towards cycling may become negative during adolescence, while attitudes towards driving improve, highlighting a need for concerted action. Evidence for other events was less consistent. Research in developing countries remain scarce and further intervention research is needed to enhance quality of evidence.},

  abstract = {To highlight the role of sustainable urban spatial structure in reducing household vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and CO2 emissions, this empirical study of the 121 largest urban areas (UAs) in the U.S. compares the effects of local land use and UA scale spatial structure in a multilevel analysis framework. The results show that centralized population and mezzo scale jobs-housing balance as well as higher UA population density can significantly reduce VMT and CO2 emissions. The combined effects of all UA level variables, including population-weighted density (PWD), are found to be on par with the elasticity of VMT with regard to a census tract level compactness index. Further, we find that urban spatial structure moderates local urban form effects on travel behavior. For example, while 10\% more compact census tracts are associated with 5\% fewer VMT in UAs with the sample average PWD, such as St. Louis and Pittsburgh, this estimated local effect increases to 7.5\% and 10\% in UAs where PWD is as high as in Chicago and New York, respectively. The findings of this study strongly support policy programs that aim to boost “articulated densities” in the urban region and call for stronger institutional frameworks for regional planning.},

We explore the effects of this modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) within the context of hedonic price models with an individual-level dependent variable. Specifically, we developed standard and spatial hedonic regression models in order to examine the effects of the MAUP on model fit and coefficient estimates. Our empirical analysis documents several significant scale and zoning effects in the hedonic modeling framework. First, neighborhood characteristics are clearly important in efforts to improve model fit—and they are more significant contributors in the standard model than in the spatial hedonic model. For aggregation scale, the model fit change of the standard model is relatively large, whereas the change is more modest for spatial models. The patterns of change in model fit for standard and spatial hedonic models clearly diverge from one another, implying the existence of a scale level showing a maximum functional range of the submarket on which scale dependencies are expected to have an impact. Regarding the zoning effect, the model fits for both standard and spatial hedonic models vary according to the submarket systems.},

  abstract = {Trip distribution laws are basic for the travel demand characterization needed in transport and urban planning. Several approaches have been considered in the last years. One of them is the so-called gravity law, in which the number of trips is assumed to be related to the population at origin and destination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical expression of this law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another popular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening opportunities which argues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only the role of a surrogate for the number of intervening opportunities between them. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two approaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them against empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different countries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening opportunities laws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the probability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called trip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the commuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We show that the gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities laws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network and to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting commuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that the different approaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for calibration since their only parameter depends only on the scale of the geographic unit.},

However, for a variety of historical reasons, transport and land use are quite divorced in practice. Typical transport engineers only touch land use planning courses once at most, and only then if they attend graduate school. Land use planners understand transport the way everyone does, from the perspective of the traveler, not of the system, and are seldom exposed to transport aside from, at best, a lone course in graduate school. This text aims to bridge the chasm, helping engineers understand the elements of access that are associated not only with traffic, but also with human behavior and activity location, and helping planners understand the technology underlying transport engineering, the processes, equations, and logic that make up the transport half of the accessibility measure. It aims to help both communicate accessibility to the public.},

  abstract = {The fuel and electricity consumptions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are sensitive to the variation of daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT). Although some researchers have assumed that DVMT follows a gamma distribution, such an assumption has yet to be validated. On the basis of continuous travel data from the Global Positioning System for 382 vehicles, each tracked for at least 183 days, the authors of this study validated the gamma assumption in the context of PHEV energy analysis. Small prediction errors caused by the gamma assumption were found in PHEV fuel use, electricity use, and energy cost. Validating the reliability of the gamma distribution paves the way for its application in energy use analysis of PHEVs in the real world. The gamma distribution can be easily specified with few pieces of driver information and is relatively easy for mathematical manipulation. Validation with real world travel data enables confident use of the gamma distribution in a variety of applications, such as the development of vehicle consumer choice models, the quantification of range anxiety for battery electric vehicles, the investigation of the role of charging infrastructure, and the construction of online calculators that provide personal estimates of PHEV energy use.},

While some efforts have been made for the demand analysis of some specific POI categories, such as restaurants, it lacks systematic means to support POI demand modeling. To this end, in this paper, we develop a systematic POI demand modeling framework, named Region POI Demand Identification (RPDI), to model POI demands by exploiting the daily needs of people identified from their large-scale mobility data. Specifically, we first partition the urban space into spatially differentiated neighborhood regions formed by many small local communities. Then, the daily activity patterns of people traveling in the city will be extracted from human mobility data. Since the trip activities, even aggregated, are sparse and insufficient to directly identify the POI demands, especially for underdeveloped regions, we develop a latent factor model that integrates human mobility data, POI profiles, and demographic data to robustly model the POI demand of urban regions in a holistic way. In this model, POI preferences and supplies are used together with demographic features to estimate the POI demands simultaneously for all the urban regions interconnected in the city. Moreover, we also design efficient algorithms to optimize the latent model for large-scale data. Finally, experimental results on real-world data in New York City (NYC) show that our method is effective for identifying POI demands for different regions.},

  abstract = {This study examines distributional characteristics of crash rates for road segments using observed accident data. The results indicate that the distribution of crash rates is mixed and right-skewed, which motivates the consideration of non-normal distributions. With the aid of Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests, kernel density plots, and Q–Q plots, the lognormal distribution is verified as an appropriate candidate for representing the positive domain of crash rates. Then, a lognormal hurdle model was developed and also compared with gamma and Weibull hurdle models. Further, the lognormal hurdle model was revised by allowing the scale parameter to vary with respect to explanatory variables. Such a modification enables the heterogeneous skewness of samples to be captured while enhancing the modeling flexibility. The proposed model was also compared with a Tobit model, an alternative approach that treats crash rates as censored data. Among all these models, the proposed lognormal hurdle model with flexible scale parameter presents the best modeling performance, and the analyses also reveal that several explanatory variables affect crash rates through not only the location parameter but also the scale parameter in the lognormal model. This study finally attempted to inspect crash rates through count models, and it discovered that the proposed hurdle model is superior because it is able to output the whole distribution form of crash rates, whereas the crash count model can only provide the expected value of crash rates, provided the exposure variable servers as an offset term in the link function of the mean parameter.

The basic features of organization structure and function derive from the characteristics of human problem-solving processes and rational human choice. Because of the limits of human intellective capacities in comparison with the complexities of the problems that individuals and organizations face, rational behavior calls for simplified models that capture the main features of a problem without capturing all its complexities. This chapter focuses on a specific set of qualities of the organization member, namely his characteristics as a rational man. The authors are concerned mostly with short-run structure-with programs to respond to sequences of situations requiring adaptive action. The "boundaries of rationality" that have been the source of our propositions have consisted primarily of the properties of human beings as organisms capable of evoking and executing relatively well-defined programs but able to handle programs only of limited complexity.

After demographic characteristics were controlled for, the measures of accessibility, land use mixing, and land use balance—computed for trip-makers’ home neighborhoods and at trip ends—proved to be highly statistically significant and influential in their impact on all measures of travel behavior. In many cases, balance, mix, and accessibility were found to be more relevant (as measured by elasticities) than several household and traveler characteristics that often form a basis for travel behavior prediction.

This study contributes by providing the empirical evidence on the relation between built environment and mode choice in context of Indian city of Rajkot. Using personal interview data and data available from Rajkot Municipal Corporation it is observed that there is a strong tendency among Rajkot residents to preselect their residential location to suit their modal preferences. This is especially true for non-motorized transport users. Among the built environment variables, access to destination and land use related indicators also have significant influence on mode choice. The study Infers that the land use policy should focus on accessibility and mixing of diverse uses, and transport supply will have to be location based to support non-motorized and public transport travel.},

In other words, these cultural and economic changes are happening in walking and transit city fabrics, but not in automobile city fabrics.},

It is concluded that ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data, although their magnitude is perhaps not as large as might have been expected. The principal difficulty is that there is at present no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques. Finally, a suggestion is made concerning how the potentially serious practical consequences can be reduced.},

It is an alternative to the conventional density measure, total population divided by total area. This paper shows that population-weighted density is equal to conventional density plus the variance in density across the subareas divided by the conventional density. This density alternative  is very dependent on the size and configuration of the subareas, an issue that has not been adequately addressed by most users. Urban sprawl is associated with lower densities, and the choice of the appropriate density measure is dependent upon the negative consequences of sprawl being considered. Comparison of conventional and population-weighted densities show the latter to be more highly skewed and to sometimes rank urban area densities very differently. Population-weighted density is more strongly related to the size of the urban area, especially size in earlier years, demonstrating the effect of the timing of urban growth on density.},

  abstract = {Using data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, we quantify the effects of settlement patterns on individual driving habits and the resulting automotive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We employ CO2 emissions to capture this impact accurately, as it reflects both vehicle miles traveled and any spatial differences in vehicle fuel efficiency choices. While previous studies have compared automotive travel in urban and suburban areas, our approach characterizes emissions across the entire US rural–urban gradient, focusing on the effects of population density. Rather than using categorical measures of contextual density (city, suburb, town, etc.), we use a geographical information system to calculate continuous measures of contextual density, that is, density at different proximities to households. These measures of contextual density allow us to model travel effects induced by the gravitational pull of the population densities of urban cores. Further, our methodological approach frames location choice as an endogenous treatment effect; that is, residential locations are not randomly assigned across our sample and significantly alter driving behavior. We find that individuals living in urban cores generate the lowest per capita automotive CO2 emissions, due to close proximities of population concentrations. Rather than attracting individuals who would likely have low CO2 emissions anyway, urban location apparently mitigates the emissions of people who would otherwise tend to have high automotive CO2 emissions. We find larger elasticities with respect to density than previous studies and also find that the attractive forces of population densities affect driving patterns at distances up to sixty-one kilometers outside of urban areas.},

  abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the utility of PEVs, as well as reduction of emissions is highly dependent on daily vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT). Further, the daily VKT by individual passenger cars vary strongly between days. A common method to analyse individual daily VKT is to fit distribution functions and to further analyse these fits. However, several distributions for individual daily VKT have been discussed in the literature without conclusive decision on the best distribution. Here we analyse three two-parameter distribution functions for the variation in daily VKT with four sets of travel data covering a total of 190,000 driving days and 9.5 million VKT. Specifically, we look at overall performance of the distributions on the data using four goodness of fit measures, as well as the consequence of choosing one distribution over the others for two common PEV applications: the days requiring adaptation for battery electric vehicles and the utility factor for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. We find the Weibull distribution to fit most vehicles well but not all and at the same time yielding good predictions for PEV related attributes. Furthermore, the choice of distribution impacts PEV usage factors. Here, the Weibull distribution yields reliable estimates for electric vehicle applications whereas the log-normal distribution yields more conservative estimates for PEV usage factors. Our results help to guide the choice of distribution for a specific research question utilising driving data and provide a methodological advancement in the application of distribution functions to longitudinal driving data.},

Measures used in the transportation engineering field include the 90th or 95th percentile travel time, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, percent of variation, buffer index, planning time index, travel time index, skew statistic, misery index, frequency of congestion, and on-time arrival. Correlations and inconsistencies between these measures were observed on a case-by-case basis in past studies, without a full explanation or examination of the fundamental causes of such differing relationships. This paper analytically examines a number of reliability measures and explores their mathematical relationships and interdependencies. With the assumption of lognormal distributed travel times and the use of percent point function, a subset of reliability measures is expressed in relation to the shape parameter or the scale parameter of the lognormal distribution or to both. This process enables a clear understanding of the quantitative relationships and variation tendencies of different measures. Contrary to some previous studies and recommendations, this paper finds that the coefficient of variation, instead of the standard deviation, is a good proxy for several other reliability measures. The use of the average-based buffer index or average-based failure rate is not always appropriate, especially when travel time distributions are heavily skewed, in which case the median-based buffer index or failure rate is recommended.},

  abstract = {Despite the wide use of utility theory to model travellers' behaviour, the interest in non-expected utility theories has increased due to their potential to capture more realistic behaviour. A main question raised is whether travellers are better described as utility maximizers or should be qualified differently.This paper presents a literature review on the use of expected utility theory (EUT), prospect theory (PT) and regret theory (RT) to model travellers' behaviour. Gaps in the literature are identified and a discussion about advantages and disadvantages of each theory is presented. A case study illustrates the differences between the theories.Under certain conditions, PT and RT restrict themselves to EUT. Their added value, however, is the possibility of capturing loss aversion, risk aversion and risk-seeking (PT) and regret aversion (RT). On the practical level, the use of EUT is well established, while contributions of PT and RT are marginal. On the theoretical level, however, RT seems to be (marginally) more suitable to model travellers' behaviour, while EUT and PT are equally suitable. This suggests that the large use of EUT is highly influenced by its very tractable framework. We do not claim the superiority of any theory, but propose to compare them through a systematic review.},

Aimed mainly at an undergraduate audience, it provides an overview of the spatial aspects of transportation and focuses on how the mobility of passengers and freight is linked with geography. The book is divided in ten chapters, each covering a specific conceptual dimension, including networks, modes, terminals, freight transportation, urban transportation and environmental impacts, and updated with the latest information available. The fourth edition offers new material on the issues of transport and the economy, city logistics, supply chains, security, energy, the environment, as well as a revised content structure. With over 160 updated photographs, figures and maps, The Geography of Transport Systems presents transportation systems at different scales ranging from global to local and focuses on different contexts such as North America, Europe and East Asia. This volume is an essential resource for undergraduates studying transport geography, as well as those interested in economic and urban geography, transport planning and engineering. A companion web site, which contains additional material, has been developed for the book and can be found here: http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/},

However, there is no consensus on the distribution below the very upper tail, because available data need to rely on "legal" rather than "economic" definitions for medium and small cities. To remedy this difficulty, we construct cities "from the bottom up" by clustering populated areas obtained from high-resolution data. We find that Zipf's law for population holds for cities as small as 5,000 inhabitants in Great Britain and 12,000 inhabitants in the US. We also find a Zipf's law for areas. JEL: R11, R12, R23},

It states that, for most countries, the size distributions of city sizes and of firms are power laws with a specific exponent: the number of cities and of firms with sizes greater than S is inversely proportional to S. Zipf's law also holds in many other scientific fields. Most explanations start with Gibrat's law of proportional growth (also known as "preferential attachment'' in the application to network growth) but need to incorporate additional constraints and ingredients introducing deviations from it. This book presents a general theoretical derivation of Zipf's law, providing a synthesis and extension of previous approaches. The general theory is presented in the language of firm dynamics for the sake of convenience but applies to many other systems. It takes into account (i) time-varying firm creation, (ii) firm's exit resulting from both a lack of sufficient capital and sudden external shocks, (iii) the coupling between firm's birth rate and the growth of the value of the population of firms. The robustness of Zipf's law is understood from the approximate validity of a general balance condition. A classification of the mechanisms responsible for deviations from Zipf's law is also offered.},

Controls for income and demographics are included in a multivariate regression model of vehicle travel that includes vehicle ownership as an intermediate factor and that treats a household's pick of neighborhood density and the amount of travel as a simultaneous relationship. The data come from the 1990 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey. It is found that density matters, but not much. A 10 percent increase in density leads to only a 0.7 percent reduction in household automobile travel. By comparison, a 10 percent increase in household income leads to a 3 percent increase in automobile travel. The results are similar when vehicle trips are used as the dependent variable. The effect of density is so small that even a relatively large-scale shift to urban densities would have a negligible impact on total vehicle travel.},

  abstract = {This paper documents the investigation of the impact of metropolitan structure on the commute behavior of urban residents in the Netherlands. Not only has the impact of monocentrism versus polycentrism been analyzed, but the influence of metropolitan density and size has also been considered, together with the ratio of employment to population and the growth of the population and employment. Furthermore, data are used at a variety of levels of analysis ranging from the individual worker to the metropolitan region rather than being drawn from aggregate level statistics alone. Multilevel regression modeling is applied to take account of the interdependencies among these levels of aggregation. With regard to mode choice, the results indicate that the probability of driving an auto to work is lower in employment-rich metropolitan regions, and rises as the number of jobs per resident has grown strongly. Furthermore, women in most polycentric regions are less likely to commute as an auto driver. All else being equal, commute distances and times for auto drivers are longer in most polycentric regions than in monocentric urban areas. In addition, commute time as an auto driver rises with metropolitan size, whereas commute distance depends on employment density and the growth of the number of jobs per resident. The investigation shows that metropolitan structure, although significantly influencing commute patterns, explains only a small part of the variation of individuals’ commute behavior.},

However, doubts about the validity of such claims are raised, primarily fueled by the low methodological quality of evaluation studies upon which such conclusions are based and by the fact that the literature is, for the most part, narratively synthesized. The present systematic review addresses these critiques by investigating the effect of soft interventions on car use through a meta-analysis, which includes only experimental and well-controlled quasi-experimental studies. Results revealed that interventions (k~=~41) lead to a significant reduction of 7\% in car modal split share (Hedges’ g~=~0.163). Moderators of interventions’ effectiveness were investigated in a meta-regression. Effectiveness was moderated by the type of intervention and by the main psychological variable targeted by the interventions, whereas the other studied moderators (i.e. residential relocation of participants, study design, percentage of females in the study, the presence of incentives, passed time to follow-up, interventions’ measurement instrument, city size in which interventions were applied and the setting where they were conducted) were non-significant. Limitations of the present findings, together with implications for policy and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Publication selection bias is a serious challenge to the integrity of all empirical sciences. We derive meta-regression approximations to reduce this bias. Our approach employs Taylor polynomial approximations to the conditional mean of a truncated distribution. A quadratic approximation without a linear term, precision-effect estimate with standard error (PEESE), is shown to have the smallest bias and mean squared error in most cases and to outperform conventional meta-analysis estimators, often by a great deal. Monte Carlo simulations also demonstrate how a new hybrid estimator that conditionally combines PEESE and the Egger regression intercept can provide a practical solution to publication selection bias. PEESE is easily expanded to accommodate systematic heterogeneity along with complex and differential publication selection bias that is related to moderator variables. By providing an intuitive reason for these approximations, we can also explain why the Egger regression works so well and when it does not. These meta-regression methods are applied to several policy-relevant areas of research including antidepressant effectiveness, the value of a statistical life, the minimum wage, and nicotine replacement therapy.

Planners base their recommendations on a substantial body of research that examines the impact of compact development on driving. Different studies, however, have found different outcomes: Some studies find that compact development causes people to drive less, while other studies do not. I use meta-regression analysis to a) explain why different studies on driving and compact development yield different results, and b) combine different findings from many studies into reliable statistics that can better inform planning practice. I address the following questions: Does compact development make people drive less, and if so, how much less? I find that compact development does make people drive less, because most of the compact development features I study have a statistically significant negative influence on driving. The impact, however, is fairly small: Compact development features do not appear to have much influence on driving. My findings are limited to some extent because they are derived from small sample sizes.Takeaway for practice: Planners should not rely on compact development as their only strategy for reducing driving unless their goals for reduced driving are very modest and can be achieved at a low cost.},

  abstract = {Among others, one commonly identified negative consequence of urban sprawl is an increase in the length of the journey to work. However, there has been more discussion of this than serious scrutiny, hence the relationship between urban sprawl and commuting patterns, especially at the intraurban level, remains unclear. Using the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) data for two Southeastern metropolitan areas, this research investigates the extent to which workers living in sprawl areas commute farther to work than those living in higher density areas. The analysis of variance confirms that workers commuting from sprawl areas to urban areas experience a longer commute in terms of time as well as mileage, though this varies when workplace and home locations are taken into account. However, multivariate statistical results suggest that there are limits to the utility of sprawl as a predictor of travel behavior compared to workers' socioeconomic characteristics, as other factors appear to be equally or more important.},

Populationweighted density, rail availability, and TDM instruments such as parking management, promotion of transit use and carpool, and employer-based TDM programs have a moderate but negative impact on CO2 emissions from household travel. On the other hand, employment and population distribution imbalance and major road network density have a moderate but positive impact on CO2 emissions from household travel.},

The purpose of this study was to improve methodology for predicting the traffic impacts of MXDs. Standard protocols were used to identify and generate data sets for MXDs in 13 large and diverse metropolitan regions. Data from household travel surveys and geographic information system databases were pooled for these MXDs, and travel and built-environment variables were consistently defined across regions. Hierarchical modeling was used to estimate models for internal capture of trips within MXDs and for walking, biking, and transit use on external trips. MXDs with diverse activities on site were shown to capture a large share of trips internally, so that the traffic impacts of the MXDs were reduced relative to conventional suburban developments. Smaller MXDs in walkable areas with good transit access generated significant shares of walk, bike, and transit trips and thus also mitigated traffic impacts.},

It does so firstly by considering the underlying philosophies of science (apparently) adopted by transport modellers, over a period of more than 50~years, from the 1950s until the present day. The conclusion is that a new philosophy of science needs to be developed, which is more in tune with how transport modelling is actually carried out (as opposed to how early transport modellers thought it ought to be carried out). It is recommended that such a new philosophy perceives transport modelling as a linguistic activity within the overall context of transport planning, which is in turn considered as a communication process. The paper outlines three main approaches that could be taken in this respect, analysing transport models from metaphorical, narrative and aesthetic perspectives. Conclusions are drawn upon the possible future research directions that might follow from the analysis provided in the paper, emphasising the importance of bringing formal philosophical thinking into transport modelling research and practice.},

However, knowledge on the roles and interactions of other factors that are influential in addition to infrastructure in cities where the cycling network is well-developed remains incomplete. In this study, we examined how various individual-level attributes, namely psychological, habitual, and socio-demographic, in addition to the built environment characteristics relate to cycling behaviour of employees of the Erasmus University Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, where comprehensive cycling infrastructure is provided. Specifically, we investigated how these factors relate to being a cyclist or not, as well as how they are associated with regular and irregular cyclists. An online survey was conducted among employees of the university and logistic regression models were utilized for the analyses. Our results showed that the perception of behavioural control is consistently correlated with different cycling behaviour while controlling for socio-demographic and residential built environment factors. Also, we found evidence supporting a trade-off between attitudes and habit across different types of commuters. Socio-demographic factors such as gender and year of immigration to the Netherlands are only related to being engaged in cycling but not to increasing the level of engagement among employees who cycled already. The type of residential area and population/business density at destinations does not appear as a consistent covariate. We concluded that psychological and habitual factors play key roles in encouraging cycling in a city with an extensive cycling infrastructure network.Highlights We examine how individual characteristics and the built environment relate to cycling.An online survey was conducted among university employees in the Netherlands.Psychological and habitual factors play key roles in the presence of cycling infrastructure.Gender and year of immigration are related to being cyclist but not in increasing its levels.Population/business density does not appear as a consistent covariate.},

Two principles, diminishing sensitivity and loss aversion, are invoked to explain the characteristic curvature of the value function and the weighting functions.

  abstract = {Studies that model the effects of land use on commuting generally use a trip-based approach or a more aggregated individual-based approach: i.e. commuting is conceptualized in terms of modal choice, distance and time per single trip, or in terms of daily commuting distance or time. However, people try to schedule activities in a daily pattern and, thus, consider tours instead of trips. Data from the 2000 to 2001 Travel Behaviour Survey in Ghent (Belgium) illustrate that car use and commuting times significantly differ between commuting trips within work-only tours and more complex tours. Therefore, this paper considers trip-related decisions simultaneously with tour-related decisions. A multiple group structural equation model (SEM) confirmed that the relationship between land use and commuting differs between work-only tours and more complex tours. Trips should be considered within tours in order to correctly understand the effect of land use scenarios such as densifying on commuting. Moreover, the use of multiple group SEM enabled us to address the issue of the complex nature of commuting. Due to interactions between various explanatory variables, land use patterns do not always have the presumed effect on commuting. Land use policy can successfully influence commuting, but only if it simultaneously accounts for the effects on car availability, car use, commuting distance and commuting time.},

To investigate the seriousness of these concerns, the data collected by Kenworthy and colleagues for European, Canadian and US cities in 1990 have been augmented with information on housing, urban development history and the sociodemographic situation. Regression models are described in which the role of urban form is investigated while account is taken of other relevant factors. The empirical analysis suggests that the space-time context of cities should be taken into account in aggregate-level comparisons of the relations between urban form and transport. Policy recommendations based on the original data may be reconsidered and tailored to the space-time context and population characteristics of cities.},

The self-activation hypothesis states that when values incorporated in the self-concept are activated, these are more likely to guide behavior. Combining these two hypotheses, it was predicted that context change enhances the likelihood that important values are considered and guide behavior. This prediction was tested in the domain of travel mode choices among university employees who had recently moved versus had not recently moved residence. As was anticipated, participants who had recently moved and were environmentally concerned used the car less frequently for commuting to work. This was found not only when compared to those who were low on environmental concern (which would be a trivial finding), but also to those who were environmentally concerned but had not recently moved. The effects were controlled for a range of background variables. The results support the notion that context change can activate important values that guide the process of negotiating sustainable behaviors.},

In the present paper I argue that the specific cost function used in the RGF model is in fact unnecessarily complicated, and that power laws can be obtained in a much simpler way by applying maximum entropy ideas directly to the Shannon entropy subject only to a single constraint: that the average of the logarithm of the observable quantity is specified.},

The second chapter is a general formal description of games of strategy, and chapters 3-8 treat particular classifications of games. In chapter 9, the authors discuss the composition and decomposition of games. Chapter 10 is on simple games, and chapter 11 on general non-zero-sum games. (These are games in which the sum of all payments received by all players is not zero. Thus such games involve production or destruction of goods and are more closely analogous to general social and economic situations than zero-sum games.)

For example, administrative boundaries, political districts, and census enumeration units are all subject to be redrawn. When data are gathered according to different boundary definitions, different data sets are generated. Analyzing these data sets will likely provide inconsistent results.

  abstract = {The estimation of commuting flows at different spatial scales is a fundamental problem for different areas of study. Many current methods rely on parameters requiring calibration from empirical trip volumes. Their values are often not generalizable to cases without calibration data. To solve this problem we develop a statistical expression to calculate commuting trips with a quantitative functional form to estimate the model parameter when empirical trip data is not available. We calculate commuting trip volumes at scales from within a city to an entire country, introducing a scaling parameter α to the recently proposed parameter free radiation model. The model requires only widely available population and facility density distributions. The parameter can be interpreted as the influence of the region scale and the degree of heterogeneity in the facility distribution. We explore in detail the scaling limitations of this problem, namely under which conditions the proposed model can be applied without trip data for calibration. On the other hand, when empirical trip data is available, we show that the proposed model's estimation accuracy is as good as other existing models. We validated the model in different regions in the U.S., then successfully applied it in three different countries.},

  abstract = {An omission error occurs when independent variables are missing from a regression model. When individual observations are not available, the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) appears with spatially aggregated data sets. Both omission error and the MAUP can occur simultaneously in regression analyses. In particular, the MAUP causes the bias due to an omission error to be less predictable for linear regression models, and it distorts bias differently with different spatial configurations. This article analyses the impacts of the MAUP on omission error and shows that the expectation of coefficient estimates at the aggregate level can be decomposed into three parts: the true coefficient, individual-level bias, and aggregate-level bias. The findings fill the gap between empirical studies in geography and theoretical results in econometrics, and show that the traditional approaches to the MAUP, such as reporting analyses from multiple spatial configurations, are unhelpful in identifying the correct coefficients.},

  abstract = {This work examines the temporal–spatial variations of daily automobile distance traveled and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and their association with built environment attributes and household socio-demographics. A GHGs household inventory is determined using link-level average speeds for a large and representative sample of households in three origin–destination surveys (1998, 2003 and 2008) in Montreal, Canada. For the emission inventories, different sources of data are combined including link-level average speeds in the network, vehicle occupancy levels and fuel consumption characteristics of the vehicle fleet. Urban form indicators over time such as population density, land use mix and transit accessibility are generated for each household in each of the three waves. A latent class (LC) regression modeling framework is then implemented to investigate the association of built environment and socio-demographics with GHGs and automobile distance traveled. Among other results, it is found that population density, transit accessibility and land-use mix have small but statistically significant negative impact on GHGs and car usage. Despite that this is in accordance with past studies, the estimated elasticities are greater than those reported in the literature for North American cities. Moreover, different household subpopulations are identified in which the effect of built environment varies significantly. Also, a reduction of the average GHGs at the household level is observed over time. According to our estimates, households produced 15\% and 10\% more GHGs in 1998 and 2003 respectively, compared to 2008. This reduction can be associated to the improvement of the fuel economy of vehicle fleet and the decrease of motor-vehicle usage – e.g., a decrease of 4\% is observed for fuel efficiency rates and 12\% for distance according to the raw average estimates from 1998 with respect to 2008. A strong link is also observed between socio-demographics and the two travel outcomes. While number of workers is positively associated with car distance and GHGs, low and medium income households pollute less than high-income households.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the relationships between the built environment—both ‘neighborhood’ design characteristics and relative location—and motor vehicle ownership and use in a rapidly motorising, developing city context, that of Santiago de Chile. A vehicle choice model suggests that income dominates the household vehicle ownership decision, but also detects a relationship between several built environment characteristics and a household’s likelihood of car ownership. A second model, directly linked to the ownership model to correct for selection bias and endogeneity, suggests a strong relationship with locational characteristics like distance to the central business district and Metro stations. Elasticities of vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT), calculated via the combined models, suggest that income plays the overall largest single role in determining VKT. In combination, however, a range of different design and relative location characteristics also display a relatively strong association with VKT.},

  abstract = {Trip generation is the first step in the traditional four-step trip-based transportation model and an important transport outcome used in evaluating the impacts of new development. There has been a long debate on the association between trip generation and the built environment, with mixed results. This paper contributes to this debate and approaches the problem with two hypotheses: 1) built environment variables have significant impacts on household total trip generation; and 2) built environment variables have different impacts on trip generation by purpose. This study relied on data from the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area to estimate negative binomial regression models of household trip generation rates across all modes. Results show that the built environment does have significant and positive influences on trip generation, especially for total number of trips, total number of tours, and home-based shopping-related trips. Moreover, log likelihood ratio tests implied that adding built environment to the base model contributed significantly to improving model explanatory and predictability. These findings suggest that transportation demand models should be more sensitive to the effects of the built environment to better reflect the variations in trip making across regions.},

  abstract = {Past decades have seen a ‘peak car’ phenomenon which is indicated by a decline in vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) in many countries. Although the determinants of VKT have been widely discussed, the theoretical arguments remain unresolved, particularly on the role of transport policies, socioeconomic factors and the built environment. This paper aims to contribute to new evidence for these arguments by examining an auto-dependent city, Wellington, New Zealand. A new bottom-up approach is applied to examine the VKT per capita in terms of its four decomposed main elements: trips (T), travel mode (V), travel distance (K), and car ownership (C) based on micro-level regressions. The results of the analysis show VKT per capita is significantly affected by parking supply, public transport quality and the built environment. These effects vary between trip type and population groups. Changing lifestyles are now major factors in the decrease of VKT.},

  abstract = {The role of self-selection in shaping travel patterns, by affecting one's home location choice, is a critical issue. Developers, planners, and policy makers regularly debate to what extent the built environment and land use patterns can alleviate roadway congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and myriad other urban problems. A study illustrates the use of Heckman's latent index model to ascertain travel impacts of neighborhood type in Austin, Texas. Under this approach, self-selection is formulated as sample selection bias in receiving a treatment. Here, treatment is defined to be one's residence in a suburban or rural zone, rather than Austin's central business district (CBD) and nearby urban zones. This approach of treatment or no-treatment is a meaningful advance in models of self-selection effects and requires estimation of three straightforward models. Depending on model specification used, results suggest that at least half (58\% to 90\%) of the differences in vehicle miles traveled observed between similar households living in CBD or urban versus rural or suburban neighborhoods of Austin is due to the location or treatment itself, whereas self-selection of such treatment (by households that wish to meet special travel needs or preferences) accounts for the remainder.},
