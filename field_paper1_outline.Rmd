# Urban Form and Auto Dependency

1. Introduction
- why is the relationship a critical question for research and policy
- scope of this review
    - theories of travel behavior 
    - auto dependency
    - measuring urban form: the 3D/5D/7D framework & beyond
    - association using observational data

2. auto dependency
- what does it mean? 
- Why does it matter?
- how is it being measured:
    - VMT
    - VHT
    - mode share
- justification to focusing on VMT

3. urban form
- what does it mean? 
- Why does it matter?
- how is it being measured:
    - 3D/5D/7D
    - ?
- scale of the measures
    - parcel/tax lot
    - census boundaries: bg, ct
    - taz
    - uza

4. empirical studies on the relationship
- the role of meta-analysis
    - review/synthesis of meta analyses
- the consensus & differences:
  - in methods/
  - criteria/
  - vintage (year the meta analysis was done)/
  - results/
  - conclusion

5. the discrepancy in previous empirical studies (needs a better chapter title)
- different measures: e.g. pop den vs emp den as density measure
- scale of the measure
- data: single region vs multiple regions
- research design
- methods

6. conclusions/hypotheses
- The difference in measure & scale creates challenges in comparing/synthesizing previous studies
- Fewer multi-regional studies
- Methods insufficient to incorporate non-linear relationship/threshold effects/interaction effect
